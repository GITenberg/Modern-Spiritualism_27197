<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For nearly fifty years Spiritualism has been before
the world. This surely is time enough to enable
it to show its character by its fruits. <span class="tei tei-q">“By their
fruits ye shall know them,”</span> is a rule that admits
of no exceptions. If evil fruits appear, the tree is
corrupt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spiritualism has made unbounded promises of
good. It has claimed to be the long-promised second
coming of Christ; the opening of a new era among
mankind; the rosy portal of a golden age, when all
men should be reformed, evil disappear, and the
renovation of society cause the hearts of men to
leap for joy, and the earth to blossom as the rose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Has it fulfilled all, or any, of these promises?
If not, is it not a deception? and if a deception,
considering its wide-spread influence, and the number
of its adherents, is it not one of the most
gigantic and appalling deceptions that has ever fallen
upon Christendom? The Bible in the plainest terms,
declares that in the last days malign influences will
be let loose upon the world; false pretensions
will be urged upon the minds of men; and deceptions,
backed up by preternatural signs and wonders,
will develop to such a degree of strength, that, if
it were possible, they would deceive the very elect.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Is it possible that Spiritualism may be the very
development of evil, against which this warning
is directed?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To investigate these questions, and to show by
unimpeachable testimony, what Spiritualism is, and
the place it holds among the psychological movements
of the present day, is the object of these pages.
Not a few books have been written against Spiritualism;
but most of them endeavor to account for it
on the ground of human jugglery and imposture, or
on natural principles, the discovery of a new and
heretofore occult force in nature, etc., from which
great things may be expected in the future. But
rarely has any one discussed it from the standpoint
of prophecy, and the testimony of the Scriptures,
the only point of view, as we believe, from which its
true origin, nature, and tendency, can be ascertained.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many features in the work of Spiritualism would
seem to indicate that the source from which it springs
is far from good; but it is based upon a church
dogma, firmly established through all Christendom,
which in many minds is of sufficient weight to overbalance
considerations that would otherwise be considered
ample grounds for shunning or renouncing it.
It is therefore the more necessary that the reader,
in examining this question, should let the bonds that
have heretofore bound him to preconceived opinions,
sit loose upon him, and that he should put himself
in the mood of Dr. Channing when he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“I
must choose to receive the truth, no matter how it
bears upon myself, and must follow it no matter
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
where it leads, from what party it severs me, or to
what party it allies.”</span> And he should remember also,
as the eminent and pious Dr. Vinet once sagaciously
observed, that <span class="tei tei-q">“even now, after eighteen centuries
of Christianity, we are very probably involved in
some enormous error, of which Christianity will, in
some future time, make us ashamed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In view, therefore, of the importance of this
question, and the tremendous issues that hang on
the decisions we may make in these perilous times,
we feel justified even in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">adjuring</span></em> the reader to
canvass this subject with an inflexible determination
to learn the truth, and then to follow it wherever
it may lead.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What think ye? Whence is it—from heaven
or of men? Such was the nature of the question
addressed by our Saviour to the men of his
time, concerning the baptism of John. It is the
crucial question by which to test every system that
comes to us in the garb of religion: Is it from
heaven or of men? And if a true answer to the
question can be found, it must determine our attitude
toward it; for if it is from heaven, it challenges
at once our acceptance and profound regard, but if
it is of men, sooner or later, in this world or in the
world to come, it will be destroyed with all its followers;
for our Saviour has declared that every
plant which our heavenly Father has not planted
shall be rooted up. Matt. 15:13.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To those who do not believe in any <span class="tei tei-q">“heavenly
Father,”</span> nor in <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ the Saviour,”</span> nor in any
<span class="tei tei-q">“revealed word of God,”</span> we would say that these
points will be assumed in this work rather than
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
directly argued, though many incidental proofs will
appear, to which we trust our friends will be pleased
to give some consideration. But we address ourselves
particularly to those who still have faith in
God the Father of all; in his divine Son, our Lord
Jesus Christ, through whose blood we have redemption;
in the Bible as the inspired revelation of God's
will; and in the Holy Spirit as the enlightener of the
mind, and the sanctifier of the soul. To all those to
whom this position is common ground, the Bible will
be the standard of authority, and the court of last
appeal, in the study upon which we now enter.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spiritualism cannot be disposed of with a sneer.
A toss of the head and a cry of <span class="tei tei-q">“humbug,”</span> will not
suffice to meet its claims and the testimony of careful,
conservative men who have studied thoroughly
into the genuineness of its manifestations, and have
sought for the secret of its power, and have become
satisfied as to the one, and been wholly baffled as to
the other. That there have been abundant instances
of attempted fraud, deception, jugglery, and imposition,
is not to be denied. But this does not by any
means set aside the fact that there have been manifestations
of more than human power, the evidence
for which has never been impeached. The detection
of a few sham mediums, who are trying to impose
upon the credulity of the public, for money, may
satisfy the careless and unthinking, that the whole
affair is a humbug. Such will dismiss the matter
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from their minds, and depart, easier subjects to
be captured by the movement when some manifestation
appears for which they can find no explanation.
But the more thoughtful and careful observers well
know that the exposure of these mountebanks does
not account for the numberless manifestations of
power, and the steady current of phenomena, utterly
inexplicable on any human hypothesis, which have
attended the movement from the beginning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Philadelphia <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">North American</span></span>, of July 31,
1885, published a communication from Thomas R.
Hazard, in which he says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">But Spiritualism, whatever may be thought of it, must
be recognized as a fact. It is one of the characteristic intellectual
or emotional phenomena of the times, and as such, it
is deserving of a more serious examination than it has yet
received. There are those who say it is all humbug, and
that everything outside of the ordinary course which takes
place at the so-called séances, is the direct result of fraudulent
and deliberative imposture; in short, that every Spiritualist
must be either a fool or a knave. The serious objection
to this hypothesis is that the explanation is almost as difficult
of belief as the occurrences which it explains. There must
certainly be some Spiritualists who are both honest and
intelligent; and if the manifestations at the séances were
altogether and invariably fraudulent, surely the whole thing
must have collapsed long before this; and the Seybert Commission,
which finds it necessary to extend its investigations
over an indefinite period, which will certainly not be less
than a year, would have been able to sweep the delusion
away in short order.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The phenomena are so well known, that it is
unnecessary to recount them here. Among them
may be mentioned such achievements as these: Various
articles have been transported from place to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
place, without human hands, but by the agency of
so-called spirits only; beautiful music has been
produced independently of human agency, with and
without the aid of visible instruments; many well-attested
cases of healing have been presented; persons
have been carried through the air by the spirits
in the presence of many witnesses; tables have been
suspended in the air with several persons upon them;
purported spirits have presented themselves in bodily
form and talked with an audible voice; and all this
not once or twice merely, but times without number,
as may be gathered from the records of Spiritualism,
all through its history.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few particular instances, as samples, it may be
allowable to notice: Not many years since, Joseph
Cook made his memorable tour around the world.
In Europe he met the famous German philosopher,
Professor Zöllner. Mr. Zöllner had been carefully
investigating the phenomena of Spiritualism, and
assured Mr. Cook of the following occurrences as
facts, under his own observation: Knots had been
found tied in the middle of cords, by some invisible
agency, while both ends were made securely fast, so
that they could not be tampered with; messages were
written between doubly and trebly sealed slates;
coin had passed through a table in a manner to illustrate
the suspension of the laws of impenetrability of
matter; straps of leather were knotted under his
own hand; the impression of two feet was given on
sooted paper pasted inside of two sealed slates;
whole and uninjured wooden rings were placed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
around the standard of a card table, over either end
of which they could by no possibility be slipped;
and finally the table itself, a heavy beechen structure,
wholly disappeared, and then fell from the top
of the room where Professor Zöllner and his friends
were sitting.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In further confirmation of the fact that real
spiritualistic manifestations are no sleight-of-hand
performances, we cite the case of Harry Kellar, a
professional performer, as given in <span class="tei tei-q">“Nineteenth
Century Miracles,”</span> p. 213. The séance was held
with the medium, Eglinton, in Calcutta, India, Jan.
25, 1882. He says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

own that I have come away utterly unable to explain by any
natural means the phenomena that I witnessed on Tuesday
evening.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He then describes the particulars of the séance.
An intelligence, purporting to be the spirit of one
Geary, gave a communication. Mr. Kellar did not
recognize the name nor recall the man. The message
was repeated, with the added circumstances of
the time and particulars of a previous meeting, when
Mr. Kellar recalled the events, and, much to his surprise,
the whole matter came clearly to his recollection.
He then adds:—
</p>

been an intelligent force which produced the writing on the

the result of trickery or sleight-of-hand.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

Another instance from <span class="tei tei-q">“Home Circle,”</span> p. 25,
is that of Mr. Bellachini, also a professional conjuror,
of Berlin, Germany. His interview was with
the celebrated medium, Mr. Slade. From his testimony
we quote the following:—

When professional conjurors bear such testimony
as this, while it does not prove Spiritualism to be
what it claims to be, it does disprove the humbug
theory.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In addition to this, it appears that two propositions,
one of $2000, and the other of $5000, have
been offered to the one who claimed to be able to
duplicate all the manifestations of Spiritualism, to
duplicate two well-authenticated tests; but the challenge
has never been accepted, nor the reward
claimed. See <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Religio-Philosophical Journal</span></span>, of Jan.

he would try an experiment. He says:—

Immediately I felt and saw myself, chair and all, lifted into

motion implying any sense of effort on the part of the lifting
force; and I was gently lowered again to the carpet. This
was in broad light, in a hotel parlor, and in presence of a
keen-eyed lawyer friend. I could plainly watch the whole
thing. No man living could have lifted me in such a
position, and besides, I saw that the psychic made not the
slightest apparent effort. Nor was there any machinery or
preparation of any kind. My companion, the lawyer, on

away from me. He held it by one hand, grasping the side
opposite to that on which the keys were fixed. In this

It was a firm grip. I could feel the print and pressure of all
the fingers. I said not a word of the strange sensation, but
quietly put my right hand down and clasped my knee in order
to see if I could feel anything on my hand. At once I felt
what seemed like the most delicate finger tips playing over
my own fingers and gradually rising in their touches toward
my wrist. When this was reached, I felt a series of clear,
distinct, and definite pats, as though made by a hand of fleshy
vigor. I made no motion to indicate what was going on, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
From the testimony already given it is evident
that there is connected with Spiritualism an agency
that is able to manifest power and strength beyond
anything that human beings, unaided, are
able to exert. It is just as evident that the same
agency possesses intelligence beyond the power of
human minds. Indeed, this was the very feature
that first brought it to the attention of the public.
Spiritualism, as the reader is doubtless aware, originated
in the family of Mr. John D. Fox, in Hydesville,
near Rochester, N. Y., in the spring of 1848.
Robert Dale Owen, in his work called <span class="tei tei-q">“Footfalls
on the Boundary of Another World,”</span> p. 290, has
given a full narration of the circumstances attending
this remarkable event. The particulars, he states,
he had from Mrs. Fox, and her two daughters, Margaret
and Kate, and son, David. The attention of
the family had been attracted by strange noises
which finally assumed the form of raps, or muffled
footfalls, and became very annoying. Chairs were
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sometimes moved from their places, and this was
once also the case with the dining-room table.
Heard occasionally during February, the disturbance
so increased during the latter part of March, as
seriously to break the nightly repose of the family.
But as these annoyances occurred only in the night-time,
all the family hoped that soon, by some means,
the mystery would be cleared away. They did not
abandon this hope till Friday, the 31st of March,
1848. Wearied by a succession of sleepless nights,
the family retired early, hoping for a respite from
the disturbances that had harassed them. In this they
were doomed to especial disappointment. We can
do no better than to let Mr. Owen continue the narrative,
in his own words:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The parents had removed the children's beds into their
bedroom, and strictly enjoined them not to talk of noises,
even if they heard them. But scarcely had the mother seen
them safely in bed, and was retiring to rest herself, when the
children cried out, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Here they are again!</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> The mother
chided them, and lay down. Thereupon the noises became
louder and more startling. The children sat up in bed.
Mrs. Fox called her husband. The night being windy, it
was suggested to him that it might be the rattling of the
sashes. He tried several to see if they were loose. Kate, the
younger girl, happened to remark that as often as her father
shook a window-sash, the noises seemed to reply. Being a
lively child, and in a measure accustomed to what was going
on, she turned to where the noise was, snapped her fingers,
and called out, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Here, old Splitfoot, do as I do!</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> The knocking
instantly responded.</span></span>

seemed instinct with intelligence. Mr. Mompesson, two hundred
years ago, had already observed a similar phenomenon.
Glanvil had verified it. So had Wesley, and his children. So
we have seen, and others. But in all these cases the matter
rested there and the observation was not prosecuted further.
As, previous to the invention of the steam engine, sundry
observers had trodden the very threshold of the discovery and
there stopped, so in this case, where the royal chaplain,
disciple though he was of the inductive philosophy, and
where the founder of Methodism, admitting, as he did, the
probabilities of ultramundane interference, were both at
fault, a Yankee girl, but nine years old, following up more in
sport than in earnest, a chance observation, became the
instigator of a movement which, whatever its true character,
has had its influence throughout the civilized world. The
spark had been ignited,—once at least two centuries ago; but
it had died each time without effect. It kindled no flame till
the middle of the nineteenth century.</span></span>

We have introduced this narrative thus at length
not only because it is interesting in itself, but because
it is of special interest that all the particulars
of the origin, or beginning, of such a movement as
this, should be well understood. The following
paragraph will explain how it came to be called
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Rochester Knockings,”</span> under which name it
first became widely known. It is from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Report
of the 37th Anniversary of Modern Spiritualism,”</span>
held in Brooklyn, N. Y., March 31, 1885, and
reported in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banner of Light</span></span>, the 25th of the

the elder of the three Fox sisters (who was on our platform),
was requested to speak. Mrs. Underhill said that she was
not a public speaker, but would answer any questions from
the audience, and in response to these questions told in a
graphic manner how the spirits came to their humble home
in Hydesville, in 1848; how on the 31st of March the first
intelligent communication from the spirit world came

through the raps; how the family had been annoyed by the
manifestations, and by the notoriety that followed; how
the younger sisters, Catherine and Margaret, were taken to
Rochester, where she lived, by their mother, hoping that this
great and apparent calamity might pass from them; how
their father and mother prayed that this cup might be taken
away, but the phenomena became more marked and violent;
how in the morning they would find four coffins drawn with
an artistic hand on the door of the dining-room of her home
in Rochester, of different sizes, approximating to the ages and
sizes of the family, and these were lined with a pink color,
and they were told that unless they made this great fact
known, they would all speedily die, and enter the spirit-world.</span></span>

their disobedience in not making this truth known to the

Hall in Rochester; how several public meetings were held
in Rochester, culminating in the selection of a committee
of prominent infidels, who, after submitting the Fox children
to the most severe tests,—they being disrobed in the presence
of a committee of ladies,—reported in their favor.... All
the time she was on our platform, there was a continuous

In the same volume of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Forum</span></span> from which
quotations have already been made, M. J. Savage
states many facts which have a determinate bearing
on the point now under consideration; namely, the
intelligence manifested in the spiritual phenomena.
From these we quote a few. He says (p. 452 and
onward):—
</p>

occurred, will not satisfy me.... I am ready to submit
some specimens of those things that constitute my problem.
They can be only specimens; for a detailed account of even
half of those I have laid by, would stretch to the limits of
a book.</span></span>
</div>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">A merchant ship bound for New York was on her homeward
voyage. She was in the Indian Ocean. The captain
was engaged to be married to a lady living in New England.
One day early in the afternoon he came, pale and excited, to
one of his mates, and exclaimed, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Tom, Kate has just died! I
have seen her die!</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> The mate looked at him in amazement,
not knowing what to make of such talk. But the captain
went on and described the whole scene—the room, her
appearance, how she died, and all the circumstances. So
real was it to him, and such was the effect on him, of his
grief, that for two or three weeks, he was carefully watched
lest he should do violence to himself. It was more than
one hundred and fifty days before the ship reached her
harbor. During all this time no news was received from
home. But when at last the ship arrived at New York, it
was found that Kate did die at the time and under the circumstances
seen and described by the captain off the coast
of India. This is only one case out of hundreds. What does
it mean? Coincidence? Just happened so? This might be
said of one; but a hundred of such coincidences become
inexplicable.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The following is another instance mentioned by
the same writer:—

<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I went to the house of a woman in New York. She was
not a professional. We had never seen each other before.
We took seats in the parlor for a talk, I not looking for any
manifestation. Raps began. I do not say whether they were
really where they seemed to be or not; I know right well
that the judgment is subject to illusion through the senses.
But I was told a </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">spirit friend</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> was present; and soon the
name, time, and place of death, etc., were given me. It was
the name of a friend I had once known intimately. But
twenty years had passed since the old intimacy; she had
lived in another State; I am certain that she and the

had died within a few months.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. Savage then gives examples where the power
in question was exclusively mental:—

<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The first time I was ever in the presence of a particular
psychic, she went into a trance. She had never seen, and, so
far as I know, had never had any way of hearing of my
father, who had died some years previously. When I was a
boy, he always called me by a special name that was never
used by any other member of the family. In later years he
hardly ever used it. But the entranced psychic said: </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">An
old gentleman is here,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> and she described certain very marked
peculiarities. Then she added: </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">He says he is your father,
and he calls you ——,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> using the old childhood name of mine.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">One case more, only, will I mention under this head.
A most intimate friend of my youth had recently died. She
had lived in another State, and the psychic did not know
that such a person had ever existed. We were sitting alone
when this old friend announced her presence. It was in this
way: A letter of two pages was automatically written,
addressed to me. I thought to myself as I read it,—I did
not speak,—</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Were it possible, I should feel sure she had written
this.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> I then said, as though speaking to her, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Will you
not give me your name?</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> It was given, both maiden and
married name. I then began a conversation lasting over an
hour, which seemed as real as any I ever have with my
friends. She told me of her children, of her sisters. We
talked over the events of boyhood and girlhood. I asked her
if she remembered a book we used to read together, and she
gave me the author's name. I asked again if she remembered
the particular poem we were both specially fond of,
and she named it at once. In the letter that was written,
and in much of the conversation, there were apparent hints
of identity, little touches and peculiarities that would mean
much to an acquaintance, but nothing to a stranger. I could
not but be much impressed. Now in this case, I know that
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
the psychic never knew of this person's existence, and of
course not of our acquaintance.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mr. Savage then mentions cases which he calls
still more inexplicable, because the information conveyed
was not known either to the psychic (which
seems to be the new name for medium) or to himself.
He says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">But one more case dare I take the space for, though the
budget is only opened. This one did not happen to me, but
it is so hedged about and checked off, that its evidential
value in a scientific way is absolutely perfect. The names
of some of the parties concerned </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">would be recognized in two
hemispheres</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. A lady and gentleman visited a psychic. The
gentleman was the lady's brother-in-law. The lady had an
aunt who was ill in a city two or three hundred miles away.
When the psychic had become entranced, the lady asked her
if she had any impression as to the condition of her aunt.
The reply was, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">No.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> But before the sitting was over, the
psychic exclaimed, </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Why, your aunt is here! She has already
passed away.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">This cannot be true,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> said the lady;
</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">there must be a mistake. If she had died, they would have
telegraphed us immediately.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">But,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> the psychic insisted,
</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">she is here. And she explains that she died about two
o'clock this morning. She also says that a telegram has been
sent, and you will find it at the house on your return.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span></span>
</div>

<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Here seemed a clear case for a test. So while the lady
started for her home, her brother-in-law called at the house
of a friend and told the story. While there the husband
came in. Having been away for some hours he had not
heard of any telegram. But the friend seated himself at his
desk and wrote out a careful account, which all three signed
on the spot. When they reached home,—two or three miles
away,—there was the telegram confirming the fact and the
time of the aunt's death, precisely as the psychic had
told them.</span></span>

during the fifty years of its modern history. It
began in a way to excite the wonder and curiosity
of the people, the very elements that would give
wings to its progress through the land. Men suddenly
found their thoughts careering through new
channels. An unseen world seemed to make known
its presence and invite investigation. As the phenomena
claimed to be due to the direct agency of
spirits, the movement naturally assumed the name
of <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritualism.”</span> It was then hailed by multitudes
as a new and living teacher, come to clear up
uncertainties and to dispel doubts from the minds of
men. At least an irrepressible curiosity was everywhere
excited to know what the new <span class="tei tei-q">“ism”</span> would
teach concerning that invisible world which it professed
to have come to open to the knowledge of
mankind. Everywhere men sought by what means
they could come into communication with the spirit
realm. Into whatever place the news entered,
circles were formed, and the number of converts
outstripped the pen of the enroller. It gathered
adherents from every walk of life—from the higher
classes as well as the lower; the educated, cultured,
and refined, as well as the uncultivated and ignorant;
from ministers, lawyers, physicians, judges,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
teachers, government officials, and all the professions.
But the individuals thus interested, being
of too diverse and independent views to agree upon
any permanent basis for organization, the data for
numerical statistics are difficult to procure. Various
estimates, however, of their numbers have been
formed. As long ago as 1876, computations of the
number of Spiritualists in the United States ranged
from 3,000,000 by Hepworth Dixon, to 10,000,000
by the Roman Catholic council at Baltimore. Only
five years from the time the first convert to Modern
Spiritualism appeared, Judge Edmonds, himself an
enthusiastic convert, said of their numbers:—

now of high standing and talent ranked among them,—doctors,
lawyers, and clergymen in great numbers, a Protestant
bishop, the learned and reverend president of a college,
judges of our higher courts, members of Congress, foreign
ambassadors, and ex-members of the United States Senate.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

Up to the present time, it is not probable that
the number of Spiritualists has been much reduced
by apostasies from the faith, if such it may be
called; while the movement itself has been growing
more prominent and becoming more widely
known every year. The conclusion would therefore
inevitably follow that its adherents must
now be more numerous than ever before. A

One of the reasons why it would be quite impossible
to state the number of real Spiritualists in our
land to-day has already been hinted at in a foregoing
extract. It is that <span class="tei tei-q">“many thousands,”</span> and we
think the number might in all probability be raised
to millions, who are in reality Spiritualists, do not
go by that name. They are in the various churches,
and are counted there. Yet they believe the phenomena
of Spiritualism, accept its teachings in their
own minds, and quietly and constantly, as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Christian
at Work</span></span> avers, consult clairvoyants and mediums,
in quest of knowledge. The grosser features of the
teachings of Spiritualism which were painfully prominent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in its earlier stages, which there is no reason
to believe are discountenanced or abandoned either
in theory or practice, are relegated to an invisible
background, while in its outward aspect it now poses
in the attitude of piety and the garb of religion. It
even professes to adopt some of the more prominent
and popular doctrines of Christianity. In this phase
the average churchgoer cannot see why he may not
accept all that Spiritualism has to give, and still
retain his denominational relationship. Besides this,
the coming to light, every now and then, of the fact
that some person of national or world-wide fame is
a Spiritualist, adds popularity and gives a new
impetus to the movement. Such instances may be
named as the founder of the Leland Stanford University,
of California; the widow of ex-Vice-President
Hendricks, of Indiana, who, it is said, is carrying
on some very successful financial transactions by
direction from the spirit world; and Mr. W. T. Stead,
London editor of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Review of Reviews</span></span>, who, in
1893 started a new quarterly, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Border
Land</span></span>, to be devoted to the advocacy of the philosophy
of Spiritualism, which he had then but recently
espoused. In other countries it has invaded the
ranks of the nobility, and even seated itself on the
thrones of monarchs. The late royal houses of
France, Spain, and Russia are said, by current
rumor, to have sought the spirits for knowledge.
No cause could covet more rapid and wide-spread
success than this has enjoyed.

<h1 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 3.46em; margin-top: 3.46em"><span style="font-size: 173%">What is the Agency in Question?</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having now shown that there are connected with
Spiritualism supermundane phenomena that
cannot be denied, and equally evident superhuman
intelligence, sufficient to give to the movement unprecedented
recognition in all the world, the way
is open for the most important question that can be
raised concerning it, and one which now demands
an answer; and that is, What is the agency by
which these phenomena are produced, and by which
this intelligence is manifested? This question must
be examined with the utmost care, and, if possible,
a decision be reached of the most assuring certainty;
for, as Mr. M. J. Savage says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritualism
is either a grand truth or a most lamentable
delusion.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is proper that the claim which Spiritualism puts
forth for itself, in this regard, should first be heard.
This is so well known that it scarcely need be stated.
It is that there is in every human being a soul, or
spirit, which constitutes the real person; that this
soul, or spirit, is immortal; that it manifests itself
through a tangible body during this earth life, and
when that body dies, passes unscathed into the unseen
world, into an enlarged sphere of life, activity, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
intelligence; that in this sphere it can still take cognizance
of earthly things, and communicate with
those still in the flesh, respecting scenes which it has
left, and those more interesting conditions still veiled
from mortal sight; that it is by these disembodied,
or <span class="tei tei-q">“discarnated”</span> spirits that raps are given, objects
moved, intelligence manifested, secrets revealed,
slates written, voices uttered, faces shown, and epistles
addressed to mortals, as friend would write to
friend. If this be true, it opens what would indeed
be considered a grand avenue of consolation to
bereaved hearts, by giving them evidence that their
departed friends still lived; that they recognized,
loved, and accompanied them, and delighted still to
counsel and instruct them. If not true, it is a masterpiece
of superhuman craft and cunning; for it
takes Christendom on the side where it is least
guarded; as the view is everywhere held that the
dead are conscious, and the only question would be
as to their power to communicate with persons still
living in the body; and it throws its arms around
the individual when the heart is the most tender,
when plunged into a condition in which every pang
of bereaved sorrow, every tie of affection, and every
throb of love, press him to crave with all his being
that communication with the dead may be proved a
fact, and to constrain him to accept the doctrine, unless
kept from it by some power stronger than the
cords that bind heart to heart in deathless love. If
it be a deception, it occupies a vantage ground before
which men may well tremble.

But, as has been already stated, the question is
here to be discussed from the standpoint of the Bible;
the Bible is to be taken as the standard of authority
by which all conflicting claims respecting the nature
of man, must be decided. The authenticity of the
Scriptures, in reference to those who deny their
authority, is an antecedent question, into the discussion
of which it is not the province of this
little work to enter. A word, however, by way
of digression, may be allowed in reference to its
authorship.

last to eternal death?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. If, then, the Bible is not the invention of
good men,—because such men would not lie and
deceive; nor of evil men,—because such men
would not condemn themselves; nor of good or evil
angels, for the same reasons, who else can be its
author, but he who claims to be, that is, the living
God?

it must be God's book, why not believe it, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To return: Appeal is therefore made to the
Bible; and the object is to learn what the Bible
teaches about Spiritualism. When the claim is put
forth that it is the disembodied spirits of dead men
who make the communications, the Bible reader is at
once aware of a conflict of claims. In times when
the Bible was written, there were practices among
men which went under the names of <span class="tei tei-q">“enchantment,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“sorcery,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“witchcraft,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“necromancy,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“divination,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“consulting with familiar spirits,”</span>
etc. These practices were all more or less related,
but some of them bear an unmistakable meaning.
Thus, <span class="tei tei-q">“necromancy”</span> is defined to mean <span class="tei tei-q">“a pretended
communication with the dead.”</span> A <span class="tei tei-q">“familiar
spirit”</span> was <span class="tei tei-q">“a spirit or demon supposed to attend
on an individual, or to come at his call; the invisible
agent of a necromancer's will.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Century Dictionary.</span></span>
Spiritualists do not deny that their intercourse
with the invisible world comes under some, at
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
least, of these heads. But all such practices the
Bible explicitly forbids.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Deut. 18:9-12: <span class="tei tei-q">“There shall not be found
among you any one that maketh his son or his
daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth
divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter,
or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">familiar

do these things are an abomination unto the Lord.”</span>
Lev. 19:31: <span class="tei tei-q">“Regard not them that have familiar
spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by
them: I am the Lord your God.”</span> See also, 2
Kings 21:2, 6, 9, 11; Rev. 21:8; Gal. 5:19-21;
Acts 16:16-18; etc. Thus plainly in both the Old
and New Testaments, are these practices forbidden.

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">An Impossibility.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But why does the Bible forbid such practices as
necromancy, or a <span class="tei tei-q">“pretended”</span> communication with
the dead?—Because it would be only a pretense at
best; for such communication is impossible. The
dead are unconscious in their graves, and have no
power to communicate with the living. Let this
truth be once established, and it is the death-blow to
the claims of Spiritualism, in the cases of all who
will receive it. Allusion has already been made to
a popular and wide-spread dogma in the Christian
church which furnishes a basis for Spiritualism. It
is that the soul is immortal, and that the dead are
conscious. Spirits make known their presence, and
claim to be the spirits of persons who have once lived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
here in human bodies. Now if the Bible teaches
that there is no such thing as a disembodied human
spirit, a knowledge of that fact would enable one to
detect at once the imposture of any intelligence
which from behind the curtain should claim to be
such spirit. Any spirit seeking the attention of men
in this life, and claiming to be what the Bible says
does not exist, comes with a falsehood on its lips or
in its raps, if the Bible is true, and thus reveals its
real character to be that of a deceiver. In this case
the Bible believer is armed against the imposture.
No man likes to be fooled. No matter therefore
how nice the communicating intelligence may seem,
how many true things it may say, or how many good
things it may promise, the conviction cannot be
evaded that no real good can be intended or conferred
by any spirit, or whatever it may be, masquerading
under the garb of falsehood, or pretending to
be what it is not. On such a foundation no stable
superstructure can be reared. It becomes a death-trap,
sure to collapse and involve in ruin all those
who trust therein.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is very desirable that the reader comprehend
the full importance of the doctrine, as related to this
subject, that the dead are unconscious and that they
have no power to communicate with the living.
This being established, it sweeps away at one stroke
the entire foundation of Spiritualism. Evidence will
now be presented to show that this is a Bible doctrine;
and wherever this is received, the fabric of
Spiritualism from base to finial falls; it cannot
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
possibly stand. But where the doctrine prevails
that only the thin veil that limits our mortal vision,
separates us from a world full of the conscious,
intelligent spirits of those who have departed this
life, Spiritualism has the field, beyond the possibility
of dislodgment. When one believes that he has
disembodied spirit friends all about him, how can
he question that they are able to communicate with
him? and when some unseen intelligence makes its
presence known, and claims to be one of those
friends, and refers to facts or scenes, known only to
them two, how can the living dispute the claim?
How can he refuse to accept a claim, which, on his
own hypothesis, there is no conceivable reason to
deny? But if the spirits are not what they claim
to be, how shall the inexplicable phenomena attending
their manifestations be explained?—The Bible
brings to view other agencies, not the so-called
spirits of the departed, to whose working all that
has ever been manifested which to mortal vision
is mysterious and inexplicable, may be justly attributed.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spiritualism declares it to be the great object of
its mission, to prove the immortality of the soul,
which, it says, is not taught in the Scriptures with
sufficient clearness, and is not otherwise demonstrated.
It well attributes to the Scriptures a lack
of plain teaching in support of that dogma; and it
would have stated more truth, if it had said that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Scriptures nowhere countenance such a doctrine at
all. But, it is said, the Scriptures are full of the
terms, <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit.”</span> Very true; but they
nowhere use those terms to designate such a part
of man as in common parlance, and in popular theology,
they have come to mean. The fact is, the
popular concept of the <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit”</span> has
been formulated entirely outside the Bible. Sedulously,
unremittingly, for six thousand years, the
idea has been inculcated in the minds of men, from
the cradle to the grave, that man is a dual being,
consisting of an outward body which dies, and an
inward being called <span class="tei tei-q">“soul,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit,”</span> which does
not die, but passes to higher spirit life, when the
body goes into the grave. The father of this doctrine
is rarely referred to by its believers, as authority,
possibly through a little feeling of embarrassment
as to its parentage; for he it was who announced
it to our first parents in these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye shall
not surely die!”</span> Gen. 3:4. When men began to
die, it was a shrewd stroke of policy on the part of
him who had promised them that they should not
die, to try to prove to those who remained that the
others had not really died, but only changed conditions.
It is no marvel that he should try to make
men believe that they possessed an immaterial, immortal
entity that could not die; but, in view of the
ghastly experiences of the passing years, it is the
marvel of marvels that he should have succeeded so
well. The trouble now is that men take these
meanings which have been devised and fostered into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
stupendous strength outside the pale of Bible teaching,
and attach them to the Bible terms of <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit.”</span> In other words, the mongrel pago-papal
theology which has grown up in Christendom,
lets the Bible furnish the terms, and paganism the
definitions. But from the Bible standpoint, these
definitions do not belong there; they are foreign to
the truth, and the Bible does not recognize them.
They are as much out of place as was the inventor
of them himself in the garden of Eden. Let the
Bible furnish its own definitions to its own terms,
and all will be clear. The opinion of John Milton,
the celebrated author of Paradise Lost, is worthy of
note. In his <span class="tei tei-q">“Treatise on Christian Doctrine,”</span>
Vol. I, pp. 250, 251, he says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Man is a living being, intrinsically and properly one
individual, not compound and separable, not, according to
the common opinion, made up and framed of two distinct
and different natures, as of body and soul, but the whole man
is soul, and the soul, man; that is to say, a body or substance,
individual, animated, sensitive, and rational.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In this sense the word is employed many times;
but whoever will trace the use of the words <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit”</span> through the Bible, will find them
applied also to a great variety of objects; as, person,
mind, heart, body (in the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“a dead body”</span>),
will, lust, appetite, breath, creature, pleasure, desire,
anger, courage, blast, etc., etc., in all nearly fifty
different ways. But it is a fact which should be
especially noted, that in not a single instance is there
the least hint given that anything expressed by these
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
terms is capable of existing for a single moment, as
a conscious entity, or in any other condition, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without
the body</span></em>! This being so, none of these, according
to the Bible, are the agency claimed to be present
in Spiritualism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another fact in reference to this point, should
be allowed its decisive bearing. The question now
under investigation is, Is the soul immortal, as Spiritualism
has taken upon itself to teach, and claims
to demonstrate? The Bible is found to be so lavish
in the use of the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit,”</span> that
these words occur in the aggregate, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventeen hundred
times</span></em>. Seventeen hundred times, by way of description,
analysis, narrative, historical facts, or declarations
of what they can do, or suffer, the Bible has
something to say about <span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit.”</span> The
most important question to be settled concerning
them, certainly, is whether they are immortal or not.
Will not the Bible, so freely treating of these terms,
answer this question? Very strange, indeed, if it
does not. But does it once affirm that either the
soul or the spirit is immortal?—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Not once!</span></em> Does
it ever apply to them the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“deathless,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“neverdying,”</span> or any word that bears the
necessary meaning of immortal?—Not in a single
instance. Does it apply to them any term from
which even an inference, necessary or remote, can
be drawn that they are immortal? Even reduced to
this attenuated form, the answer is still an emphatic
and overwhelming, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">No!</span></em> Well, then, does it say
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anything</span></em> about the nature and capabilities of existence
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of that which it denominates soul or spirit?—Yes;
it says the soul is in danger of the grave, may
die, be destroyed, killed, and that the spirit may be
wounded, cut off, preserved, and so, conversely,
made to perish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is sometimes claimed that it is not necessary
that the Bible should affirm the immortality of the
soul, because it is so self-evident a fact that it is taken
for granted. But no one surely can suppose that
the immortality of the soul is more self-evident than
that of Jehovah; yet the Bible has seen fit to affirm
his immortality in most direct terms. 1 Tim. 1:17:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Now unto the King eternal, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immortal</span></em>, invisible,
the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and
ever. Amen.”</span> 1 Tim. 6:16: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who only hath
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immortality</span></em>, dwelling in the light which no man
can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor
can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting.
Amen.”</span> Let, then, similar Bible testimony
be found concerning the soul; that is, that it is
<span class="tei tei-q">“immortal,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“hath immortality,”</span> and the taken-for-granted
device will not be needed.

From the fact now established that the soul is
not immortal, it would follow as an inevitable
conclusion, that the dead are not conscious in the
intermediate state, and consequently cannot act
the part attributed to them in modern Spiritualism.
But there are some positive statements to which
the reader's attention should be called, and some
instances supposed to prove the conscious state
which should be noticed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Dead Know not Anything.</span></span>—As a sample
of the way the Bible speaks upon this question, let
the reader turn to the words of Solomon, in Eccl.
9:5, 6, 10: <span class="tei tei-q">“For the living know that they shall
die: but the dead know not anything, neither have
they any more a reward; for the memory of them
is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and
their envy, is now perished; neither have they any
more a portion for ever in anything that is done
under the sun.... Whatsoever thy hand findeth
to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work,
nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the
grave, whither thou goest.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This language is addressed to the real, living,
intelligent, responsible man; and how could it be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
plainer? On the hypothesis of the commonly believed
distinction between the soul and the body,
this must be addressed to the soul; for the body
considered as the mere material instrument through
which the soul acts, is not supposed of itself to know
anything. The body, as a body, independent of the
soul, does not know that it shall die; but it is that
which knows, while one is alive, that it shall die—it
is that same intelligent being that, when dead,
knows not anything. But the spirits in Spiritualism
do know many things in their condition; therefore
they are not those who have once lived on this earth,
and passed off through death; for such, once dead,
this scripture affirms, know not anything—they are
in a condition in which there is <span class="tei tei-q">“no work, nor device,
nor knowledge, nor wisdom.”</span> This is a plain,
straightforward, literal statement; there is no mistaking
its meaning; and if it is true, then it is not
true that the unseen agents working through Spiritualism,
are the spirits of the dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Spirit Returns to God.</span></span>—Another passage
from the same writer and the same book, may
recur to the mind of the reader, as expressing a
different and contradictory thought. Eccl. 12:7.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was:
and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.”</span>
A careful analysis of this passage reveals no support
for Spiritualism; for it does not say that the spirit,
on returning to God, is conscious, or is capable of
coming back and communicating with mortals. It is
not denied that different component parts enter into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the constitution of man; and that these parts may
be separated. Solomon himself may therefore tell
us what he means by the term <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit”</span> which he
here uses. He employs the same word in chapter.
3:21 of this same book, but says that beasts have
it as well as men. And then in verse 19, he explains
what he means, by saying that they (man
and the lower animals) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> have one <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">breath</span></em>. The
record of man's creation in Gen. 2:7, shows that a
vitalizing principle, called the <span class="tei tei-q">“breath of life,”</span> was
necessary to be imparted to the organized body, before
man became a living being; and this breath of
life, as common to man and to all breathing animals,
is described in Gen. 7:21, 22, by the term רוח
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ruahh</span></span>), the same word that is used for <span class="tei tei-q">“breath,”</span>
in Eccl. 3:19, <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit,”</span> in verse 21, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the
spirit,”</span> which God gave to man, and which returns
to God, in chapter 12:7. Thus it is clear that reference
is here made simply to the <span class="tei tei-q">“breath of life”</span>
which God at first imparted to man, to make him a
living being, and which he withdraws to himself, in
the hour of man's death. Job states the same fact,
and describes the process, in chapter 34:14, 15:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If he [God] set his heart upon man, if he gather
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unto himself</span></em> his [man's] spirit [same word] and his
breath; ... man shall turn again unto dust.”</span> No
one can fail to see here that Job refers to the same
event of which Solomon speaks.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And at this point the question may as well be
raised, and answered, Whence comes this spirit
which is claimed to be the real man, capable of an
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
independent and superior existence without the
body? Bodies come into existence by natural generation;
but whence comes the spirit? Is it a part
of the body? If so, it cannot be immortal; for
<span class="tei tei-q">“that which is born of the flesh is flesh.”</span> John
3:6. Is it supplied to human beings at birth? If
so, is there a great storehouse, somewhere, of souls
and spirits, ready-made, from which the supply is
drawn as fast as wanted in this world? And if so,
further, is it to be concluded that all spirits have had
a pre-existence? and then what was their condition
in that state? And again, how does it happen, on
this supposition, that this spirit in each individual
exhibits so largely the mental and moral traits of
the earthly parents? These hypotheses not being
very satisfactory, will it be claimed that God creates
these spirits as fast as children are born to need
them? and if so, who brings them down just in the
nick of time? and by what process are they incarnated?
But if God has, by special act, created a
soul or spirit for every member of the human family
since Adam, is it not a contradiction of Gen. 2:2,
which declares that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> God's work of creation, so
far as it pertains to this world, was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">completed</span></em> by the
close of the first week of time? Again, how many
of the inhabitants of this earth are the offspring of
abandoned criminality; and can it be supposed that
God holds himself in readiness to create souls which
must come from his hands pure as the dew of heaven,
to be thrust into such vile tenements, and doomed
to a life of wretchedness and woe at the bidding of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
defiant lust? The irreverence of the question will
be pardoned as an exposure of the absurdity of that
theory which necessitates it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Spirits of Just Men Made Perfect.</span></span>—This
expression is found in Heb. 12:23, and seems, by
some, to recognize the idea that spirits can exist
without the body, and are to be treated as separate
entities. Thus interpreted it might appear to give
some support to Spiritualism. But it will by no
means bear such an interpretation. The apostle is
contrasting the privileges of Christians in the present
dispensation, with the situation of believers before the
coming of Christ. What he sets forth are blessings
to be enjoyed in the present tense. Yes, says one,
that is just what I believe: We are come to spirits;
they are all about us, and tip and talk and write for
us at our pleasure. But hold! nothing is affirmed
of spirits separately. The whole idea must be taken
in. It is the <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">just men</span></em> made perfect;”</span>
and the participle <span class="tei tei-q">“made perfect”</span> agrees with
<span class="tei tei-q">“just men,”</span> or literally <span class="tei tei-q">“the just made perfect”</span>
(δικαίων τετελειωμένων), not with <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits.”</span> It is the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">men</span></em> who are made perfect to whom we are said to
have come. But there are only two localities and
two periods, in which men are anywhere in the
Scriptures said to be made perfect. One is in this
life and on this earth, and refers to religious experience
(<span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father
which is in heaven is perfect”</span>); the other is not
relative, but actual and absolute, and refers to the
future immortal state when all the people of God
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
will enter upon eternal life together (<span class="tei tei-q">“God having
provided some better thing for us, that they [the
ancient worthies] without us should not be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">made
perfect</span></em>.”</span> Heb. 11:40). Thus, taken in either of
the only two ways possible, the text furnishes no
proof of Spiritualism. It doubtless refers to the
present state, the expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits of just men,”</span>
being simply a periphrasis for <span class="tei tei-q">“just men,”</span> the same
as the expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“the God of the spirits of all
flesh”</span> (Num. 16:22), means simply <span class="tei tei-q">“the God of
all flesh,”</span> and the words <span class="tei tei-q">“your whole spirit, and
soul, and body”</span> (1 Thess. 5:23), means simply
the whole person.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spirits in Prison.</span></span>—The apostle Peter uses
an expression, which, though perhaps not often
quoted in direct defense of Spiritualism, is relied
upon extensively in behalf of the doctrine of the
conscious state of the dead, which, as already shown,
is the essential basis of Spiritualism. And such
texts as these are here noticed to show to the general
reader, that the Bible contains no testimony in
behalf of that doctrine, but positively forbids it, as
further quotations will soon be introduced to show.
The passage now in question is 1 Peter 3:19, where,
speaking of Christ, it says: <span class="tei tei-q">“By which also he went
and preached unto the spirits in prison.”</span> By the
use of strong assumption, and some lofty flights of
the imagination, and keeping in the background the
real intent of the passage, a picture of rather a lively
time in the spirit world, can be constructed out of
this testimony. Thus the spirits are said to be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the disembodied spirits of those who were destroyed
by the flood. See context. They were in <span class="tei tei-q">“prison,”</span>
that is, in hell. When Christ was put to death upon
the cross, he immediately went by his disembodied
spirit, down into hell and preached to those conscious
intelligent spirits who were there, and continued that
work till the third day when he was himself raised
from the dead. A thought will show that this
picture is wrong, (1) in the time, (2) in the condition
of the people, (3) in the acting agent, and (4) in the
end to be attained. Thus, when Christ had been
put to death, he was <span class="tei tei-q">“quickened”</span> (or made alive),
says the record, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the Spirit.”</span> This was certainly
not a personal disembodied spirit, but that
divine agency so often referred to in the Scriptures.
<span class="tei tei-q">“By which,”</span> that is, this Spirit of God, he went
and preached. Then he did not go personally on
this work. The <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits”</span> were the antediluvians;
for they were those who were disobedient in the
days of Noah. Now when were they preached to?
Verse 20 plainly tells us it was <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when</span></em> once the
longsuffering of God waited <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the days of Noah</span></em>.”</span>
In accordance with these statements now let another
picture be presented: Christ, by his Spirit which was
in Noah (1 Peter 1:11), and thus through Noah,
preached to the spirits, or persons, in Noah's time,
who were disobedient, in order to save all from the
coming flood who would believe. They were said
to be <span class="tei tei-q">“in prison,”</span> though still living, because they
were shut up under condemnation, and had only one
hundred and twenty years granted them in which to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
repent or perish. Thus Christ was commissioned
to preach to men said to be in prison, because in
darkness, error, and condemnation, though they
were still living in the flesh. Isa. 61:1. Dr.
Adam Clarke, the eminent Methodist commentator
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in loco</span></span>), places the going and preaching of Christ
in the days of Noah, and by the ministry of Noah
for one hundred and twenty years, and not during
the time while he lay in the grave. Then he says:—

5. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cannot Kill the Soul.</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“Fear not them
which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul:
but rather fear him which is able to destroy both
soul and body in hell.”</span> Matt. 10:28. We know
what it is to kill the body; and by association of
ideas, it seems quite natural to form a like conception
of the soul as something that can be treated in
the same way. Then if the soul cannot be killed
like the body, the conclusion seems easy of adoption
that it lives right on, with all sensations preserved,
as it was with the body before its death. If it were
not for the pagan definition of <span class="tei tei-q">“soul,”</span> which here
comes in to change the current of thought, such
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conclusions drawn from this text would not be so
prevalent; and a little attention to the scope of
Christ's teaching here will readily correct the misapprehension.
This is brought out clearly in verse
39: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that findeth his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">life</span></em> shall lose it: and he
that loseth his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">life</span></em> for my sake shall find it.”</span> This
is easily understood. No one will question what it
is to lose his life; and Christ says that he who will
do this for his sake, shall find it. Any one who has
been put to death for his faith in the gospel has
<span class="tei tei-q">“lost his life”</span> (had the body killed) for Christ's
sake. But Christ says, Do not fear them, even if
they do this. Why?—Because ye shall find it—the
life you lost. When shall we find it?—In the
resurrection. John 6:40; Rev. 20:4-6. The expression,
<span class="tei tei-q">“shall find it,”</span> thus becomes the exact
equivalent of the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“are not able to kill the
soul;”</span> that is, are not able to destroy, or prevent us
from gaining that life he has promised, if we suffer
men, for his sake, to <span class="tei tei-q">“kill the body,”</span> or deprive us
of our present life. The correctness of this view is
demonstrated by the word employed in these instances.
That word is ψυχή (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">psuche</span></span>). It is properly
rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“life”</span> in verse 39, and improperly rendered
<span class="tei tei-q">“soul”</span> in verse 28. This lesson, that men
should be willing to lose their life for Christ's sake,
was considered so important that it is again mentioned
in Matthew, and reiterated with emphasis by
Mark, Luke, and John; and they all use this same
word ψυχή, which is rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“life.”</span> In one instance
only in all these parallel passages have the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
translators rendered it <span class="tei tei-q">“soul;”</span> and that is Matt.
10:28, where it is the source of all the misunderstanding
on that text.

6. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Souls Under the Altar.</span></span>—As a part of the
events of the fifth seal as described in Rev. 6:9-11,
John says he saw the souls of the martyrs under the
altar, and heard them crying for vengeance. If they
could do that, it is asked, cannot disembodied souls
now communicate with the living? Not to enter
into a full exposition of this scripture, and the inconsistencies
such a view would involve, it is sufficient
to ask if these were like the communicating spirits of
the present day. How many communications have
ever been received by modern Spiritualists from
souls confined under an altar? In glowing symbolism,
John saw the dead martyrs, as if slain at the
foot of the altar; and by the figure of personification
a voice was given to them, just as Abel's blood
cried to God for vengeance upon his guilty brother
(Gen. 4:10), and just as the stone is said to cry
out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber
to answer it. Hab. 2:11.

7. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Medium of Endor.</span></span>—Aside from the
direct teaching of the Scriptures, it is still held by
some that there are scenes narrated in the Bible
which show that the dead must be conscious. The
first of these is the case of Saul and the woman of
Endor, whom he consulted in order to communicate
with the prophet Samuel, as narrated in 1 Samuel 28.
Here, it must be confessed, is brought to view
an actual case of spirit manifestation, a specimen of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ancient necromancy; for the conditions, method of
procedure, and results, were just such as pertain to
the same work in our own day. But then, as now,
there was no truth nor good in it, as a brief review
of the narrative will show. (1) Samuel was dead.
(2) Saul was sore pressed by the Philistines. Verse
5. (3) God had departed from him. Verse 4.
(4) He had cut off those who had familiar spirits
and wizards, out of the land, because God had forbidden
their presence in the Jewish theocracy, as
an abomination. Verse 3; Lev. 19:31. (5) Yet
in his extremity he had recourse to a woman with
a familiar spirit, found at Endor. Verse 7. (6)
She asked whom she should bring up, and Saul
answered, Samuel. Verse 11. (7) Saul was disguised,
but the familiar spirit told the woman it was
Saul, and she cried out in alarm. Verse 12. (8)
Saul reassured her, and the woman went on with
the séance. Verse 10. (9) She announced a presence
coming (not from heaven, nor the spheres,
but) up out of the earth, and at Saul's request gave
a description of him, showing that Saul did not himself
see the form. Verse 13. (10) Saul <span class="tei tei-q">“perceived”</span>
that it was Samuel (not by actual sight, but
from the woman's description; for the Hebrew ירע
and the Septuagint, γινωσκώ, signify to know, or
perceive, by an operation of the mind.) Verse 14.
(11) The woman supposed it was Samuel; Saul
supposed it was Samuel; and that personation is,
then, by the law of appearance, spoken of, in whatever
it said or did, as Samuel; as, <span class="tei tei-q">“Samuel said to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Saul,”</span> etc. Verse 15. (12) Was Samuel really
there as an immortal soul, a disembodied spirit, or
as one raised from the dead?—No; because (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) immortal
souls do not come up out of the ground,
wrapped in mantles, and complain of being disquieted
and brought up; (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Samuel was a holy
prophet, and if he was conscious in the spirit world,
he would not present himself at the summons of a
woman who was practicing arts which God had forbidden;
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) God having departed from Saul, and
having refused to communicate with him on account
of his sins, would not now suffer his servant Samuel
to grant him the desired communication through a
channel which he had pronounced an abomination;
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) Samuel was not present by a resurrection, for
the Devil could not raise him, and God certainly
would not, for such a purpose; besides Samuel was
buried at Ramah, and could not be raised at Endor;
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) It was only the woman's familiar spirit, personating
Samuel as he used to appear when alive—an
aged man clothed with a mantle. His object was to
make both the woman and Saul believe it was
Samuel, when it was not, just as communicating
spirits to-day try to palm themselves off for what
they are not. As a specimen of ancient Spiritualism,
this case is no particular honor to their cause;
and as a proof of the immortality of the soul, and
the conscious state of the dead, it is a minus
quantity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Transfiguration.</span></span>—Jesus took three of
his disciples, Peter, James, and John, apart into a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
high mountain, and was transfigured before them;
his face became as the sun, and his raiment was
white as the light, just as it will be in the future
kingdom of glory, which this scene was designed to
represent. And there then appeared Moses and
Elias talking with Christ. But Moses had died in
the land of Moab nearly fifteen hundred years
before, and it is at once concluded that the only
way to account for his appearance on this occasion,
is to suppose that he was still alive in the spirit
world, and could appear in a disembodied state,
and talk with Jesus as here represented. But such
a conclusion is by no means necessary. Jesus was
there in person, Elias was there in person; for he
had not died, but had been translated bodily from
this earth. Now it would be altogether incongruous
to suppose that the third member of this glorious
trio, apparently just as real as the others, was only a
disembodied spirit; an immaterial phantom. Unless
the whole scene was merely a vision brought before
the minds of the disciples, Moses was as really there,
in his own proper person, as Jesus and Elias. But
there is no way in which he could thus be present,
except by means of a resurrection from the dead;
and that he had been raised, and was there as a
representative of the resurrection, is proved, first by
his actual presence on this occasion, and secondly,
by the fact that Michael (Christ, who is <span class="tei tei-q">“the resurrection
and the life,”</span> John 11:25) disputed with
the Devil (who has the power of death, Heb. 2:14)
about the body of Moses. Jude 9. There could be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
no other possible ground of controversy about the
body of Moses except whether or not Christ should
give it life before the general resurrection. But
Christ rebuked the Devil. Christ was not thwarted
in this contest, but gave his servant life; and thus
Moses could appear personally upon the mount.
This makes the scene complete as a representation
of the kingdom of God, as Peter says it was (2 Peter
1:16-18); namely, Christ the glorified King, Elias
representing those who will be translated without
seeing death, and Moses representing those who will
be raised from the dead. These two classes embrace
all the happy subjects of that kingdom. This view
of the matter is not peculiar to this book. Dr.
Adam Clarke, on Matt. 17:3, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The body
of Moses was probably raised again, as a pledge of
the resurrection.”</span><a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> And Olshausen says: <span class="tei tei-q">“For
if we assume the reality of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">resurrection of the
body</span></em>, and its glorification,—truths which assuredly
belong to the system of Christian doctrine,—the
whole occurrence presents no essential difficulties.
The appearance of Moses and Elias, which is usually
held to be the most unintelligible point in it, is
as easily conceived of as possible, if we admit their
bodily glorification.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those passages which speak of Christ as the
<span class="tei tei-q">“first-fruits,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“first-born from the dead,”</span> the
<span class="tei tei-q">“first-born among many brethren,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“of every creature,”</span>
etc., refer only to the chief and pivotal importance
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his own resurrection, as related to all
others; and Acts 26:23 does not declare that Christ
should be the first one to be raised from the dead,
but that he first, by a resurrection from the dead,
should show light to the Gentiles. (See the Greek
of this passage.) These scriptures therefore prove
no objection to the idea that Moses had been raised
from the dead, and as a victor over the grave, appeared
with Christ upon the mount. Thus another
supposed stronghold affords no refuge for the conscious-state
theory, or for Spiritualism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Rich Man and Lazarus.</span></span>—With the features
of this parable, as found in Luke 16, which is
supposed to prove the dead conscious, and Spiritualism
possible, the reader is doubtless familiar. It
should ever be borne in mind that this is a parable;
and in a parable, neither the parties nor the scenes
are to be taken literally, and hence no doctrines
can be built upon such symbolic representations.
But not only is it a parable, but it is a parable
based upon traditions largely entertained by the
Jews themselves in the time of Christ. Thus
T. J. Hudson (<span class="tei tei-q">“Law of Psychic Phenomena,”</span> p.
385) says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It is a historical fact, nevertheless, that before the advent
of Jesus, the Jews had become imbued with the Greek
doctrine of Hades, which was an intermediate waiting station
between this life and the judgment. In this were situated
both Paradise and Gehenna, the one on the right, and the
other on the left, and into these two compartments the spirits
of the dead were separated, according to their deserts. Jesus
found this doctrine already in existence, and in enforcing
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
his moral precepts in his parables, he employed the symbols
which the people understood, neither denying nor affirming
their literal verity.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus Christ appealed to the people on their own
ground. He took the views and traditions which he
found already among them, and arranged them into
a parable in such a way as to rebuke their covetousness,
correct their notions that prosperity and riches
in this life are tokens of the favor and approbation
of God, and condemn their departure from the teachings
of Moses and the prophets. As a parable, it
is not designed to show the state of the dead, and
the conditions that prevail in the spirit world. But
if any persist that it is not a parable, but a presentation
of actual fact, then the scene is laid, not in
the intermediate state, but beyond the resurrection;
for it is after the angels had carried Lazarus into
Abraham's bosom. But the angels do not bear any
one anywhere away from this earth, till the second
coming of Christ and the resurrection of the dead.
Matt. 24:30, 31; 1 Thess. 4:15-17. Finding no
support in this portion of scripture for the conscious-state
theory, with its spiritualistic possibilities, appeal
is next made by the friends of that theory to the
case of—
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
10. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Thief on the Cross.</span></span>—Luke 23:39-43.
When one of the malefactors who were crucified
with Jesus, requested to be remembered when he
should come into his kingdom, according to the
record in the common version, the Lord replied,
<span class="tei tei-q">“To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”</span> To
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
go from death into paradise the same day, means to
go into the spirit world without a body, or discarnated,
as Spiritualists claim. And so it would be
if such was Christ's promise to the thief; but it
was not.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The little adverb <span class="tei tei-q">“to-day”</span> holds the balance
of power as to the meaning of this text. If it qualifies
Christ's words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Verily I say unto thee,”</span> it
gives one idea; if it qualifies the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt
be with me in paradise,”</span> we have another and very
different idea. And how shall the question of its
relationship be decided?—It can be done only by the
punctuation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here another difficulty confronts us; for the
Greek was originally written in a solid line of letters,
without any punctuation, or even division into
words. Such being the case, the punctuation, and
the relation of the qualifying word <span class="tei tei-q">“to-day,”</span> must
be determined by the context. Now it is a fact that
Christ did not go to paradise that day. He died, and
was placed in the tomb, and the third day rose from
the dead. Mary was the first to meet him, and
sought to worship him. But he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Touch me
not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father.”</span> John
20:17. Paradise is where the Father is (see 2 Cor.
12:2-4; Rev. 2:7; 22:1, 2), and if Christ had not
been to his Father when Mary met him the third day
after his crucifixion, he had not then been to paradise;
therefore it is not possible that he made a
promise to the thief on the day of his crucifixion,
that he should be with him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> day in paradise.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But further, the day of the crucifixion was the
day before the Sabbath; and it was not lawful to
leave criminals on the cross during that day. John
19:31. If they were still living when the time came
to take them from the cross, they were taken down,
and their legs were broken to prevent their escape.
The soldiers on this occasion broke the legs of the
two thieves, because they were still alive; <span class="tei tei-q">“but
when they came to Jesus and saw that he was
dead already, they brake not his legs.”</span> Verses
32, 33. The thief therefore lived over into the
next day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus there are two absolutely insuperable objections
against allowing the adverb, <span class="tei tei-q">“to-day,”</span> to
qualify Christ's promise, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt be with me in
paradise:”</span> (1) Christ did not go to paradise that
day; and (2) The thief did not die that day. Before
these facts the conscious-state argument built upon
this incident, vanishes into thin air. Just place the
comma (a punctuation mark not invented till 1490)
after <span class="tei tei-q">“to-day”</span> instead of before it, and let that
word qualify the verb <span class="tei tei-q">“say”</span> and emphasize the
time when it was spoken, and all is harmonious.
The thief's request did not pertain to that day, but
looked forward to the time when Christ should come
into his kingdom; and Christ's promise did not
pertain to that day, but to the time in the thief's
request; so he did not falsify it by not going to
his Father for three days afterward. The thief is
quietly slumbering in the tomb; but Christ is soon
coming into his kingdom. Then the thief will be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
remembered, be raised from the dead, and be with
Christ in that paradise into which he will then
introduce all his people. Thus all is as clear as a
sunbeam, when the text is freed from the bungling
tinkering of men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The strongest texts and incidents which are appealed
to in defense of the conscious-state theory,
have now been examined. If these do not sustain
it, nothing can be found in the Bible which will
sustain it. All are easily harmonized with these.
Thus in Paul's desire to <span class="tei tei-q">“depart and be with
Christ”</span> (Phil. 1:23), he does not there tell us
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when</span></em> he will be with Christ; but he does tell us in
many other places; and it is at the resurrection and
the coming of Christ. Phil. 3:11; 1 Thess. 4:16,
17. When he speaks of our being clothed upon
with our house from heaven (2 Cor. 5:2), he tells
us that it is when <span class="tei tei-q">“mortality”</span> is <span class="tei tei-q">“swallowed up of
life.”</span> But that is only at the last trump. 1 Cor.
15:51-54. If we are told about the woman who
had had seven husbands (Matt. 22:23-28), no hint
is given of any reunion till after the resurrection.
If God calls himself <span class="tei tei-q">“not the God of the dead, but
of the living”</span> (Matt. 22:32), it is because he
speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“those things that be not as though they
were”</span> (Rom. 4:17), and the worthies of whom this
is spoken, are sure to live again (Heb. 11:15, 16),
and hence are now spoken of as alive in his sight,
because they are so in his purpose. Texts which
speak of the departure and return of the soul (Gen.
35:18; 1 Kings 17:21, 22), are referable to the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“breath of life,”</span> which is the meaning of the word
in these instances rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“soul.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Three passages only have been referred to, which
declare positively that the dead know not anything.
It was thought preferable to answer certain objections,
before introducing further direct testimony.
But there are many such passages, a few more of
which will now be presented, as a fitting conclusion
to this branch of the subject. The reader's careful
attention is invited to a few of the various texts, and
the conclusions that follow therefrom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Death and Sleep.</span></span>—Death, in numerous passages
is compared to sleep, in contrast with the
wakeful condition. See Ps. 13:3; Job 7:21; John
11:11; Acts 7:60; 1 Cor. 11:30; 15:51; 1 Thess.
4:14; etc. But there is only one feature in sleep
by virtue of which it can be taken as a figure of
death; and that is, the condition of unconsciousness
which shuts up the avenues of one's senses to all
one's environment. If one is not thus unconscious
in death, the figure is false, and the comparison
illogical and misleading.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thoughts Perish.</span></span>—So David testifies: <span class="tei tei-q">“Put
not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in
whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he
returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts
perish.”</span> Ps. 146:3, 4. The word <span class="tei tei-q">“thoughts”</span>
does not here mean simply the projects and purposes
one has in view, which do often fail, when the
author of them dies, but it is from a root which
means the act of thinking, the operation of the mind;
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and in death, that entirely ceases. It cannot therefore
be the dead who come out of the unseen with
such intelligence as is shown in Spiritualism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Job's Statement.</span></span>—Speaking of a dead man,
Job (14:21) says: <span class="tei tei-q">“His sons come to honor, and
he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he
perceiveth it not of them.”</span> If the dead cannot take
cognizance of matters of so much interest as these,
how can they communicate with the living as the
spirits do?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">No Remembrance of God.</span></span>—David, in Ps.
6:5 and 115:17, again testifies: <span class="tei tei-q">“For in death
there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
shall give thee thanks?”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The dead praise not the
Lord, neither any that go down into silence.”</span> Is it
possible that any righteous man, if he is living and
conscious after going into the grave, would not
praise and give thanks to the Lord?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hezekiah's Testimony.</span></span>—Hezekiah was sick
unto death. Isa. 38:1. But he prayed, and the
Lord added to his days fifteen years. Verse 5.
For this he praised the Lord, and gave his reasons
for so doing in the following words (verses 18, 19):
<span class="tei tei-q">“For the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot
celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot
hope for thy truth. The living, the living, he
shall praise thee, as I do this day.”</span> This is a clear
affirmation that in death he would not be able to do
what he was able to do while living.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Testament Evidence.</span></span>—The New Testament
bears a corresponding testimony on this subject.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
None will be saved except such as Christ
raises up at the last day. John 6:39, 40. No one
is to receive any reward before the resurrection.
Luke 14:14; 2 Tim. 4:8. No one can enter God's
kingdom before being judged; but there is no execution
of judgment before the coming of Christ.
2 Tim. 4:1; Acts 17:31; Luke 19:35; etc. If
there is no avenue to a future life by a resurrection,
then all who have gone down in death are perished.
1 Cor. 15:18. Such texts utterly forbid the idea of
consciousness and activity, on the part of any of the
human family, in death.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This part of the subject need not be carried
further. It has been dwelt upon so fully simply
because of its determinate bearing on the question
under discussion. Spiritualism rests its whole title
to credence on the claim that the intelligences which
manifest themselves are the spirits of the dead.
The Bible says that they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the spirits of the
dead. Then if the Bible is true, the whole system
rests upon deception and falsehood. No one who
believes this will tamper with Spiritualism. One
cannot have Spiritualism and the Bible, too. One or
the other must be given up. But he who still holds
on to the theory that the dead are conscious, contrary
to the testimony of the Scriptures has no shield
against the Spiritualistic delusion, and the danger is
that he will sooner or later throw the Bible away.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the Bible plainly shows what the spirits which
communicate are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>, it just as clearly reveals
also what they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em>; so that in no particular is one
left to conjecture or guesswork. There is an order
of beings brought to view in the Scriptures, above
man but lower than God or Christ, called <span class="tei tei-q">“angels.”</span>
No Bible believer questions the existence of such
beings. It is sometimes asserted that angels are
departed human spirits; but this cannot be; for they
appear upon the stage of action before a single
human being had died, or a disembodied spirit could
have existed. When the world was created, Job
declares that <span class="tei tei-q">“the morning stars sang together, and
all the sons of God shouted for joy.”</span> These are
two of the names applied to these beings, but they
are also known by a number of others. They are
167 times called angels; 61 times, angel of the Lord;
8 times, angel of God; 17 times, his angels; 41
times, cherub and cherubim. There are also such
names as seraphim, chariots, God's hosts, watchers,
holy ones, thrones, dominions, principalities and
powers,—all referring to the different orders of
these heavenly beings.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A part of this host fell into sin, and thereby
became evil, or fallen, angels. A reasonable statement
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of how this came about can be given, but no
reason for the act itself. Sin cannot be explained.
To explain it would be to give a reason for it; and
to give a reason for it would be to excuse it; and
then it would cease to be sin. In the beginning a
condition existed which was in itself right and essential;
but which nevertheless made sin possible. It
is one of the inevitable conditions of the highest
glory of God, that all his creatures should serve him
from choice, under the law of love, and not by compulsion,
as a machine, under the law of necessity.
To secure this end, they must be made free moral
agents. Thus to angels was given the freedom of
the will, the same as to man. They were in a state
of purity and happiness, with every condition favorable
for a continuance in that condition; but in the
free choices of their free wills, they of course had
the power, if they should unaccountably see fit so
to use it, to turn away from truth and right, and
rebel against God. This some of them did. So
we find Jude speaking of <span class="tei tei-q">“the angels that kept not
their first estate”</span> (Jude 6), and Peter, of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
angels that sinned”</span> (2 Peter 2:4); and these they
further declare, were cast down to Tartarus, and are
reserved in everlasting chains under darkness, unto
the judgment of the great day.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There must have been to this rebellion an instigator
and leader; and we accordingly find the Bible
speaking of such a personage; the whole company
being described as <span class="tei tei-q">“the Devil and his angels.”</span>
Our Lord pointed out this leader in evil, and his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
work, in John 8:44: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are of your Father the
Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.
He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own:
for he is a liar and the father of it.”</span> This reveals
the great facts in his case. He abode not in the
truth. Then he was once in the truth; and as he is
a liar, and the father of it, he was the first one to
depart from truth and introduce falsehood and evil
into the universe of God.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Isaiah (14:12-14) this being is addressed as
Lucifer, or the day-star; and the prophet exclaims,
<span class="tei tei-q">“How art thou fallen from heaven, 0 Lucifer,
son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the
ground, which didst weaken the nations!”</span> The following
verses indicate that the nature of his transgression
was self-exaltation and pride of heart:
<span class="tei tei-q">“For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend
into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars
of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation,
in the sides of the north: I will ascend
above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the
Most High.”</span> Paul, in 1 Tim. 3:6, intimates that
it was this pride that caused the ruin of this once
holy being. Of an elder he says that he must not
be a novice, <span class="tei tei-q">“lest being lifted up with pride he fall
into the condemnation of the Devil,”</span> or that sin for
which the Devil was condemned.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Ezekiel 28, Satan is again spoken of under the
pseudonym of <span class="tei tei-q">“the prince of Tyrus.”</span> Verse 2
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shows his pride: <span class="tei tei-q">“Because thine heart is lifted up,
and thou hast said, I am a God, I sit in the seat
of God,”</span> etc. Verses 12-15 describe his beauty,
wisdom, and apparel, and his exalted office as a
high cherub, before his sin and fall. Verse 15
reads: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the
day thou wast created, till iniquity was found in
thee.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These passages give us a sufficient idea of the
origin of Satan and how such an incarnation of evil
has come to exist. The Tartarus into which he and
his angels were cast, according to Peter, is defined
by leading lexicographers, as meaning the dark,
void, interplanetary spaces, surrounding the world.
Using the serpent as a medium, this apostate angel,
thus cast out, plied our first parents with his temptation
by preaching to them the immortality of the
soul, <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not surely die,”</span> and alas! seduced
them also into rebellion. The dominion which was
given to Adam (Gen. 1:28), Adam thus alienated to
Satan, by becoming his servant; for Paul says,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves
servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye
obey?”</span> Rom. 6:16. Now, consequently, such
titles as <span class="tei tei-q">“prince of this world,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“prince of the
power of the air,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“god of this world,”</span> etc., are
applied to him, because he has by fraud usurped that
place. John 14:30; Eph. 2:2; 2 Cor. 4:4. He,
of course, employs <span class="tei tei-q">“his angels”</span> to co-operate with
him in his nefarious work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus clearly do we have set before us just the
agencies,—the Devil and his angels,—which are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
adapted, both by nature and inclination, to carry on
just such a work as is seen in Spiritualism. But
how do we know, some one may ask, but that Spiritualism
is the work of the good angels?—We know
that it is not, because good angels do not lie. They
never would come to men, professing to be the
spirits of their dead friends, and imitate and personate
them to deceive, knowing that the mediums did
not know, and could not ascertain that they were
altogether another and different order of beings.
But the evil angels, led by the father of lies, and
cradled, and drilled, and skilled, and polished, in the
school of lying, would be delighted to deceive men
in this very way, by pretending to be their dead
friends, and then by working upon their affections
and love for the ones they could skilfully personate,
bring them under their influence and lead them captive
at their will.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These evil angels are experts in deception. They
have had six thousand years' experience. They are
well acquainted with the human family. They can
read character. They study temperament. They
acquaint themselves minutely with personal history.
They know a thousand things which only they and
the individual they are trying to ensnare, are aware
of. They know many things beyond the knowledge
of men. They can easily carry the news of the
decease of a friend, and the description of a death-bed
scene, to other friends thousands of miles away,
and months before the truth through ordinary channels
can reach them, so that when it is verified, their
influence over them may be increased. (See page <a href="#Pg023" class="tei tei-ref">23</a>.)
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is nothing that has yet taken place, of however
inexplicable a nature, and nothing which even
the imagination may anticipate, which is not, and will
not be, easily attributable to these unseen angels.
They are lying spirits; for the fundamental principle
on which they are acting is a lie; but they tell enough
truth to sway and captivate the minds of men. It
matters not how sacred the field in which they tread,
nor how hallowed the associations which they invade,
they press into every spot where it is possible, by
spinning another thread, to strengthen their web of
deception.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And in what dulcet and siren tones they woo their
victims to lay aside all resistance to their influence,
to become receptive and passive, and yield themselves
to their control; and when they have them
thus helpless in their arms, they deliberately and
cruelly instil into their minds the virus of ungovernable
lust, the leprosy of unconquerable rebellion
against the government of Heaven. That this language
does not misrepresent nor slander them, will
be shown from their own testimony, before the close
of this book.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The thought is not overlooked that many even of
those who do not profess to be Spiritualists, deny
the existence of any such being as a personal Devil,
or of personal evil angels, his agents. He is no
doubt well pleased with this, as such people can the
more easily be made the victims of his wiles. But
these same persons would no doubt acknowledge the
existence, as real beings, of God, Christ, and the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
good angels. This fact being established, by parity
of reasoning the Devil and his angels become real
beings also. The same arguments which show that
God and Christ exist as personal beings may be used
to show that the Devil and his angels are personal
beings also. He who denies that there is a personal
Devil, must be prepared also to deny that there is a
personal Christ. So far as the argument for personal
existence is concerned, Christ and good angels stand
on one side of the equation, and the Devil and his
angels on the other; and whoever would rub out the
one, must rub out the other also.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Christ said that he <span class="tei tei-q">“beheld Satan as lightning fall
from heaven.”</span> Luke 10:18. John in the Revelation
(12:7) beheld a war in heaven. <span class="tei tei-q">“Michael
[Christ] and his angels fought against the dragon
[Satan]; and the dragon fought, and his angels.”</span>
On the ground that there is no Devil, this would be
a wonderful battle—Christ and his angels, who are
real beings, fighting furiously against myths and
nonentities which have not even the substance of a
phantom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To endorse the doctrine of a personal Devil, is not
to endorse the grossly absurd caricatures conjured
up by morbid imaginations, and popular theology,—a
being with bat's wings, horns, hoofs, and a
dart-pointed tail. Yet upon such pictorial fables he
doubtless looks with complacency; as they are
calculated still further to destroy faith in his existence,
and enable him the better to cover his tracks
and carry on his work among men. Nevertheless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the only rational hypothesis on which to account for
the present condition of this world (which every one
must admit is full of devilishness), the existence of
evil, and the presence of sickness, suffering, and
death, is the account the Bible gives us of fallen
angels and fallen men. Unfallen angels are beings
of mighty power. One of them slew in one night
185,000 Assyrians (2 Kings 19:35); and the one
who appeared at the time of Christ's resurrection
had a countenance like the lightning, and raiment
white as snow, and before him the keepers of the
tomb fell like dead men. Matt. 28:3, 4. A fall
from their high estate, though it would impair their
strength and power, cannot be supposed to have
wholly deprived them of these qualities; therefore
the fallen angels still have capabilities far superior
to those of men. The only defense mankind has
against them is found in Christ, who circumscribes
their power (for they are kept in chains, 2 Peter
2:4), and makes provision by which we may resist
them. Eph. 6:11; James 4:6-8; 1 John 5:18.
The question why they are permitted to continue
finds solution in the thought that God is consistently
giving to sin time and opportunity to develop itself,
fully show its nature, and manifest its works, to all
created intelligences, so that when it shall finally be
wiped out of existence, with all its originators, aiders,
and abetters, as in God's purpose it is to be (Rev.
20:14, 15; 2 Peter 3:7, 13; Rev. 5:13), there will
ever after remain an object-lesson sufficient to safe-guard
the universe against a repetition of the evil.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Only some 6000 years are allotted to this work of
evil; and 6000 years are as nothing compared with
eternity.

<h2 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 2.88em; margin-top: 2.88em"><span style="font-size: 144%">Warnings Against Evil Spirits.</span></h2>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Scriptures plainly point out the working of
these agents of wickedness, and warn us against
them. In 1 Tim. 4:1, we read: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now the Spirit
speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some
shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing
spirits, and doctrines of devils.”</span> This shows that
these spirits make it an object to seduce, or deceive,
to draw men away from the true faith, and cause
them to receive, instead, the doctrines they teach,
which are called <span class="tei tei-q">“doctrines of devils;”</span> and this
scripture is written to put men on their guard
against them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Again Paul says: <span class="tei tei-q">“For we wrestle not against
flesh and blood, but against principalities, against
powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this
world, against spiritual wickedness [margin, <span class="tei tei-q">‘wicked
spirits’</span>] in high places.”</span> Eph. 6:12. And he
adjures his readers to put on the whole armor of
God to be able to resist them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The apostle Peter exhorts to the same purpose:
<span class="tei tei-q">“Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary
the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking
whom he may devour: whom resist steadfast in
the faith.”</span> 1 Peter 5:8, 9. If our ears do not
deceive us, a good deal of this roaring is heard in
the ranks of Spiritualists, where, by invisible rapping,
agitated furniture, clairvoyance, clairaudience,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
writing, speaking, marvels, and wonders, he seeks
to set the world on tiptoe of curiosity and expectation,
and bewilder men into a departure from the
faith and the acceptance of the doctrines of devils.
He is cunning enough not to <span class="tei tei-q">“roar”</span> in a way to
frighten and repel, but only to attract attention, and
lead multitudes, through an overweening curiosity
and wonder at the marvels, to come thoughtlessly
within the sphere of his influence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prophet Isaiah also has something to say
directly upon this subject: <span class="tei tei-q">“And when they shall
say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar
spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:
should not a people seek unto their God? for the
living to the dead?”</span> Isa. 8:19. That is, is it
consistent for living people to go to dead ones for
their knowledge? The following verse shows where
we should go for light and truth: <span class="tei tei-q">“To the law and
to the testimony: if they speak not according to
this word, it is because there is no light in them.”</span>
The time has certainly come when many are saying
just what the text points out, and seeking to the
dead, to familiar spirits, and wizards, for knowledge.
Those practices which in the Bible are
enumerated as <span class="tei tei-q">“charming,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“enchantment,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“sorcery,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“witchcraft,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“necromancy,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“divination,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“consulting with familiar spirits,”</span> etc., are more or
less related, and are all really from one source. So
in modern times different names indicate substantially
the same thing. Thus Mr. Hudson, in
<span class="tei tei-q">“Psychic Phenomena,”</span> p. v, says:—
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It has, however, long been felt by the ablest thinkers of
our time that all psychic manifestations of the human intellect,
normal or abnormal, whether designated by the name
of mesmerism, hypnotism, somnambulism, trance, spiritism,
demonology, miracle, mental therapeutics, genius, or insanity,
are in some way related.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Seven, at least, of the foregoing names are no
doubt in the warp and woof of Spiritualism; and
he might have added mind-reading and Christian
Science. And Spiritualists admit that their work is
the same as that described by the Bible terms above
quoted. Thus, Allen Putnam, a Spiritualistic writer,
says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The doctrine that the oracles, soothsaying, and witchcraft
of past ages were kindred to these manifestations of our
day, I, for one, most fully believe.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a pamphlet by the same author, entitled,
<span class="tei tei-q">“Mesmerism, Spiritualism, Witchcraft, and Miracle,”</span>
p. 6, he says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">As seen by me now, Mesmerism, Spiritualism, Witchcraft,
Miracles, all belong to one family, all have a common
root, and are developed by the same laws.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To all these, therefore, the text under notice
(Isa. 8:19, 20) applies. We are to bring them to
the standard of <span class="tei tei-q">“the law and the testimony,”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“if they speak not according to this word ...
there is no light in them.”</span> The living should not
seek to the dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In Rev. 16:13, 14, the same spirits are again
brought to view, and called <span class="tei tei-q">“unclean spirits,”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“spirits of devils.”</span> Their last work of deception
is to go forth to the kings of the earth, and of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
whole world, to gather them to the battle of the
great day of God Almighty. Thus all that is revealed
of them from beginning to end (and scriptures
might be multiplied on the point) furnishes
the most cogent reason why all should be keenly
awake to their existence and their work, and be ever
watchful against their influence and approach.

<h1 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 3.46em; margin-top: 3.46em"><span style="font-size: 173%">What The Spirits Teach.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been shown in the preceding chapters that
the unseen <span class="tei tei-q">“controls”</span> (the beings who control
the mediums) in Spiritualism, are not the spirits of
the dead, but are fallen angels or spirits of devils.
This fact will be confirmed by a brief glance at some
of their teachings; for we are to remember that if
they speak not according to the law and the testimony
there is no light in them. It matters not that
what they teach may be supported by signs and
wonders beyond the comprehension of the human
mind. That is no guarantee of truth; for such phenomena
are to be wrought, as will soon be shown,
to prove a lie. The Lord anciently put his people
on their guard in this respect. Deut. 13:1-3, 5:
<span class="tei tei-q">“If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer
of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and
the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he
spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods,
which thou hast not known, and let us serve them;
thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that
prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the Lord
your God proveth you, to know whether ye love
the Lord your God with all your heart and with all
your soul.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“And that prophet, or that dreamer of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
dreams, shall be put to death; because he hath spoken
to turn you away from the Lord your God, ... out
of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee
to walk in.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the fact that one who professed to be a
prophet could perform a sign or wonder, showing
his connection with some unseen power, was not
enough to shield him from condemnation and punishment,
if what he undertook to prove by that sign
or wonder was contrary to the truth, and tended to
lead away from God. The teaching of any system
is an important part of the fruit it bears; and by
that, according to our Lord's own rule, we are to
judge it, and not by any power or mighty works
connected with it, however wonderful they may be.

human stands above all things else, and holds within its
embrace all the past, present, and future. In this sense he
is created and exists in the image of God.</span></span>

The Devil, through the serpent in the garden,
taught Adam and Eve that the soul is immortal,
and has transfused the same idea very successfully
through paganism, Romanism, and Protestantism;
but he also said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye shall be as gods;”</span> and now,
it seems, he is trying to make the world swallow this
other leg of his falsehood; but by putting it forth
under the form of the old pagan pantheism, that
everything is God, and God is everything, he betrays
the lie he uttered in Eden; for in that case, Adam
and Eve were no more gods after they ate than they
were before.

Another séance, reported in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banner</span></span> about
twenty years later than the one quoted above, April
28, 1888; an inquirer addressed to the <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits”</span> a
question about God, and received answer, a portion
of which is presented below:—

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

believes in a personal God. True, many Spiritualists and
many returning spirits offer their invocations to the </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Great
Supreme Spirit of all life and intelligence,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> not because they
expect to change the order of law, or to come into direct
communication with, or nearness to, a Great Supreme Being,
clothed in the image of man, but because they desire to enter
an atmosphere of harmony, to uplift their own souls to a
plane of thought which will bring spiritual inspiration to
their minds. We make a distinction between that Great
Supreme Overruling Force which we may call the Superior
Spirit of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Love, and the personal
Deity, clothed in the image of man, gigantic in stature,
jealous and revengeful by nature, which has been set up and
worshiped as the Christian Jehovah. We know of no Spiritualist—let
us repeat it—who believes in such a personal
God; but we can believe and accept the idea, though it may
pass beyond almost our finite comprehension, that there is a
grand universal Spirit permeating all forms of existence;
that this great source of light, of activity and vitality
vibrates with intelligence, and that it is superior to all
organic forms, however grand they may prove to be.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

The same views have been taught all along by
the <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits”</span> of Spiritualism, as could be shown by
extracts dating as far back as 1858, only ten years
after the <span class="tei tei-q">“Rochester Knockings.”</span> And though
Spiritualism is now assuming more of the sedate
speech of organized Christianity, the spirits do
not modify their teaching in respect to God. In
<span class="tei tei-q">“Automatic, or Spirit, Writing,”</span> p. 148 (1896), are
given many messages from the spirits through the
mediumship of Mrs. S. A. Underwood, wife of the
editor of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophical Journal</span></span>, Chicago. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“spirits”</span> set forth their teaching in answer to questions
by the medium, some of which have reference
to God, though his name is not used. Thus on page

It will be perceived that the answers to these
questions are, from the beginning, evasive; but the
real idea entertained clearly shines through the thin
veil drawn over to conceal it. The questions pertain
to the source, or authorship, of the <span class="tei tei-q">“laws of
spiritual life;”</span> and this would generally be understood
to be God. But on a technicality the spirits
refuse to answer. The question is made plainer,
and the answer is that <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits are not bondaged
by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">persons</span></em>;”</span> that is to say that spirits have nothing
to do with personalities, and that no personal
being has anything to do with those laws. There is
therefore no God who formulates and promulgates
them. No wonder the question followed, how they
came to know these laws; and it was a very convenient
answer that we will know when we get there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and have lost all physical perceptions. A desire for
some explanation of those laws is met with the not
very satisfactory information that they (the spirits)
would have to give those in our sphere a course of
teaching, like a college course, before we could understand
even the rudimentary laws of Being. The
only thing clear in all this is that there is no God;
at least no personal God such as the Bible reveals.
To the <span class="tei tei-q">“grand whole,”</span> whatever that may be, they
give the name of the <span class="tei tei-q">“All of Being.”</span> In answer to a
question concerning <span class="tei tei-q">“personalities,”</span> they are called
<span class="tei tei-q">“atoms emanating from the same source—parts
of the great All of Being, partaking of the general
characteristics of the grand whole.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Page 149.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Reader, how does all this compare in your own
mind with the God of the Bible, the Creator of all
things, the loving Father of us all, who has for his
creatures more tender regard and pity than a father
can feel for his own children, whose very name and
nature is Love, and who has purposed infinite good
for all men, and will carry it out unless they, as free
moral agents, by their own sin, prevent his doing for
them what he desires to do? The Bible is not responsible
for the aspersions cast upon God by a
false theology, which misrepresent his character and
give occasion for the charges of vindictiveness and
vengeance and awful tyranny, so freely made by
fallen angels and wicked men. They do not belong
to him who is the source of all goodness and mercy;
and we would labor to bring those who have perverted
views of God back to a right conception of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the great Friend of sinners, as he has revealed himself
in his holy word.

2. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They Deny Jesus Christ.</span></span>—Christ is revealed
as the divine Son of the Father; and to deny that he
was or is any more than any other man is surely to
deny him; and the scripture says that <span class="tei tei-q">“whosoever
denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father.”</span>
1 John 2:23. The following is what the <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits”</span>
began to teach in the earliest stages of Spiritualism
concerning Christ:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">What is the meaning of the word Christ?—'Tis not, as
generally supposed, the Son of the Creator of all things. Any
just and perfect being is Christ. The crucifixion of Christ is
nothing more than the crucifixion of the spirit, which all
have to contend with before becoming perfect and righteous.
The miraculous conception of Christ is merely a fabulous
tale.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Spiritual Telegraph, No. 37.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How fully does this declaration that any good
man is Christ open the way for the fulfilment of the
Saviour's prophecy that in the last days many
false Christs and false prophets shall arise, and shall
deceive many. See Matt. 24:24. A prospectus
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Truth Seeker</span></span> contained these words: <span class="tei tei-q">“It
shall be the organ through which the christs of the
last dispensation will choose to speak.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A little later, July 19, 1862, there was published
in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banner of Light</span></span> a lecture on Spiritualism by
Mrs. C. L. V. Hatch, in which she spoke of Christ
as follows:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Of Jesus of Nazareth, personally, we have but little to
say. Certain it is, we find sufficient that is divine in his life
and teachings, without professing to believe in the fables of

theologians respecting his birth and parentage. We are content
to take the simple record as it stands, and to regard him
as the son of Joseph and Mary, endowed with such purity and
harmony of character as fitted him to be the Apostle and
Revelator of the highest wisdom ever taught to man. It is
the fundamental article in the creed of modern Christianity,
that Jesus was divine in his nature, and of miraculous origin
and nativity. Now, no human being of ordinary intelligence,
unwarped by educational bias, would ever profess to believe in
such a monstrous figment, which only shows the blindness of
superstitious prejudice.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

Here is something twenty-four years later. A
séance reported in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banner of Light</span></span>, Oct. 9,
1886, gives the following questions and answer:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some years ago a class was formed in New York
City for the purpose of investigating what is called
the spiritual philosophy. Before that class, Dr.
Weisse said:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Friend Orton seems to make rather light of the communications
from spirits concerning Christ. It seems, nevertheless,
that all the testimony received from advanced spirits
only shows that Christ was a medium and reformer in Judea;
that he now is an advanced spirit in the sixth sphere; but
that he never claimed to be God, and does not at present. I
have had two communications to that effect. I have also
read some that Dr. Hare had. If I am wrong in my views of
the Bible, I should like to know it, for the spirits and mediums
</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">do not contradict me</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The peculiar insult here purposely offered to the
Saviour will be appreciated when it is noted that at
about the same time the spirits located Thomas Paine,
the well-known skeptic, in the seventh sphere, one
sphere above that of Christ. He must therefore
have progressed very rapidly, seeing he so quickly
surpassed Christ, who had over 1700 years the start
of him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Before the same class Dr. Hare is reported to
have spoken as follows, which we give without
assuming any responsibility for the spiritual grammar
therein exhibited:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">He said that he had been thus protected from deception
by the spirits of Washington and Franklin, and that they
had brought Jesus Christ to him, with whom he had also
communicated. He had first repelled him as an impostor;
but became convinced afterward that it was really him. He
related that he had learned from that high and holy spirit,
that he was not the character that Christendom had represented
him to be, and not responsible for the errors connected
with his name, but that he was, while on earth, a medium of
high and extraordinary powers, and that it was solely through
his mediumistic capabilities that he attained so great knowledge,
and was enabled to practice such apparent wonders.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When Christ was upon earth, it was envy, jealousy,
and malice that moved the Pharisees against
him (Matt 27:18); and it seems that he is followed
by the same feelings in the spirit world. This is
natural; for he who fired the hearts of the Pharisees
with their malignant spirit, is the same one, as we
have seen, who is working through the powers of
darkness in the unseen world to-day. Any way to
degrade Christ in the minds of men to a level with,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or below, the mediums of our time, and make it
appear that they can do as great wonders as he,
seems to be the object in view.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is plainly manifest an irrepressible desire
on the part of spirits and mediums to show Christ
to be inferior to the leaders of other great religions
of the world, as Buddha, Confucius, Zoroaster, etc.
Thus, at a seance held in 1864 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banner of Light</span></span>,
June 4), the spirits were questioned as follows:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

two.... Jesus himself claims to have been inspired to a
large extent, by this same Confucius. And if we are to place
reliance upon the records concerning each individual, we
shall find that Jesus spoke the truth when he tells us that he
was inspired by Confucius.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Indeed! Where are the records referred to?
Where and when did Jesus <span class="tei tei-q">“speak”</span> the words
attributed to him? And where does he tell <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">us</span></em>, that
he was inspired by Confucius? So we are to believe,
are we, that the gospel of Jesus Christ, is only a
rehash of what was originally wrought out in the
brain of Confucius, and not words fresh from the
fountain of light given him by his Father in heaven,
to speak, as he claimed them to be? Yet he was a
high and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">holy</span></em> medium. We wonder what standard
of holiness and perfection the spirits can have.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But still later, in 1896, we find the spirits putting
forth the same teaching in reference to Jesus Christ.
In <span class="tei tei-q">“Automatic, or Spirit Writing,”</span> pp. 148, 149,

Thus they persist in denying that Jesus holds any
pre-eminent position as a religious teacher. He may
as well be called Buddha, Krishna, or Mohammed
as Jesus. They are all the same spirit, all atoms of
the great <span class="tei tei-q">“All of Being,”</span> all as much alike as three
drops of water from the same ocean, and what is
more bewildering still, they have now all lost their
individuality in the spirit world. How, then, can it
be told that Christ is in the sixth sphere, and Paine
in the seventh? Such teachers, though they may
claim to be good spirits, are branded as antichrist by
both John and Jude. John says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is a liar but
he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist
that denieth the Father and the Son.”</span> 1 John
2:22. Again, <span class="tei tei-q">“Every spirit that confesseth not
that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God.”</span> 1 John 4:3. According to the spirits,
Jesus Christ has no more come in the flesh than
have Buddha, Mohammed, Confucius, Zoroaster, or
any other religious teacher. They all simply yielded
to their environments, and showed marked individualism
while on this earth, and have now become
absorbed in the <span class="tei tei-q">“great whole”</span> in the spirit world.
Thus, as Jude says (verse 4), they deny <span class="tei tei-q">“the only
Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So much for their denial of Christ in his person.
They also deny him in his offices; for to deny and
ridicule what he came to do, is one of the most
effectual ways of denying him. The great work of
Christ was the shedding of his blood to atone for the
sins of the world; and the spirits are particularly
bitter in denouncing that idea. If such sentiments
were uttered only by open and professed scoffers, it
would not do so much harm; but it is not unusual
to find those bearing the title of <span class="tei tei-q">“Reverend”</span> descanting
on these themes in a manner to show themselves
antichrist, according to the definition of that
term by John. And even this need not surprise us;
for the sure word of prophecy has foretold that some
who have once held the true faith will depart therefrom
to give heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines
of devils. 1 Tim. 4:1.

Dr. Hare said:—

A <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit”</span> calling himself Deacon John Norton,
as reported in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banner of Light</span></span>, said:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I used to believe in the atonement; I honestly believed
that Christ died to save the world, and that by and through
his death all must be saved if saved at all. Now I see that
this is folly—it cannot be so. The light through Christ, the
Holy One, shone in darkness; the darkness could not comprehend
it; and thus it crucified the body, and Christ died a
martyr. He was not called in that way, that by the shedding
of his blood, the vast multitude coming after him
should find salvation. Everything in nature proves this
false. They tell me here that Christ was the most perfect
man of his time. I am told here also that he is worthy to be
worshiped, because of his goodness; and where man finds
goodness he may worship. God's face is seen in the violet,
and man may well worship this tiny flower.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In the pantheism of Spiritualism, every object in
nature, the tiny flower, the pebbles, the trees, the
birds and bees, are worthy to be worshiped as much
as Christ. In one breath the spirits extol him as a
most perfect man, pre-eminent in goodness and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
worthy to be worshiped, and in the next, place him
in a position which would make him the greatest
fraud and impostor that ever lived. Such inconsistencies
show that Christ is a miracle which evil
men and evil angels know not how to dispose of.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As they deny Christ, they must, logically, deny
the doctrine of his second coming. This doctrine is
made of especial importance and prominence in the
New Testament. The nature of that coming, its
manner, and the circumstances attending it are so
fully described, that no one who adopts the Bible
view can possibly be deceived by false christs.
But the church and the world have been turned
away from the true doctrine of the second advent,
and the way is thus prepared for the great deceptions
of the last days. Spiritualism is one of these, and
claims that it is itself that second coming. Joel
Tiffany, a former celebrated teacher of Spiritualism,
has said:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And through Mrs. Conant, a famous medium of
the early days of Spiritualism, the controlling spirit
said:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

not be known to you.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%"> Spiritualism is that second coming of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the Bible description of this event is, the
revelation of the Lord himself in the clouds of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
heaven in the glory of the Father, the reverberating
shout of triumph, the voice of the archangel, the
trump of God, the flash of his presence like that of
the lightning, the wailing of the tribes of the earth,
as they thus behold him, while unprepared to meet
him, and the resurrection of the righteous dead.
And where and when have these inseparable accompaniments
of that event been seen? They do not
occur when a person is converted from sin, nor do
they occur in the dying chamber, nor have they
occurred in Spiritualism; and until they do take
place, the second coming of Christ is not accomplished.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many seek to dispose of such testimony as this,
by making it all figurative, or meeting it with a bold
denial, as in the case of the resurrection of the body.
And the way has been too well prepared for this
condition of things, by much of the teaching of
popular orthodoxy, which turns the early records of
the Bible into childish allegory, perverts the true
doctrine of the coming and kingdom of Christ, and
denies the resurrection of the dead, by destroying
its necessity through the immortality of the soul.
On the vital point of the resurrection, Dr. Clarke
makes this noteworthy remark:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">One remark I cannot help making,—The doctrine of the

consequence among the primitive Christians than it is </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">now</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">!
How is this?—The apostles were continually insisting on it,
and exciting the followers of God to diligence, obedience, and
cheerfulness through it. And their successors in the present
day seldom mention it! So the apostles preached, and so the
primitive Christians believed; so we preach and so our hearers
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
believe. There is not a doctrine in the gospel on which more
stress is laid; and there is not a doctrine in the present system
of preaching which is treated with more neglect.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">On

3. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They Deny the Bible.</span></span>—The denial of God
and Christ, as set forth above is, of course, a denial
of the Bible; and not much need therefore be added
on this point. We quote only a few representative
utterances. Doctor Hare (<span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritual Science Demonstrated,”</span>
p. 209) says:—

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As to the Old Testament, it would seem doubtful
whether Mr. Hare ever read far enough to find (1) Job
exclaiming: <span class="tei tei-q">“For I know that my Redeemer liveth,
and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
and though after my skin worms destroy this body,
yet in my flesh shall I see God: whom I shall see for
myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another;
though my reins be consumed within me”</span> (or, as
the margin reads: <span class="tei tei-q">“My reins within me are consumed
with earnest desire [for that day];”</span>) or
(2) David: <span class="tei tei-q">“I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
thy likeness;”</span> or (3) Isaiah: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thy dead men shall
live, together with my dead body shall they arise.
Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust;”</span> or
(4) Ezekiel: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, O my people, I will open
your graves, and cause you to come up out of your
graves;”</span> or (5) Daniel: <span class="tei tei-q">“Many of them that sleep
in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting
life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt;”</span>
and (6) Hosea: <span class="tei tei-q">“I will ransom them from
the power of the grave, I will redeem them from
death.”</span> Job 19:25-27; Ps. 17:15; Isa. 26:19;
Eze. 37:12; Dan. 12:2; Hosea 13:14. And as
for the New Testament, it is no doubt <span class="tei tei-q">“disgusting”</span>
to many Spiritualists to read that <span class="tei tei-q">“the fearful, and
unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers,
and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and
all liars, shall have their part in the lake which
burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second
death;”</span> and that without the city <span class="tei tei-q">“are dogs, and

Communications from spirits are offered in place
of the Bible as a better source of instruction, the
Bible being denounced, as above quoted, as <span class="tei tei-q">“vague,
inaccurate, and difficult to believe.”</span> A brief comparison

this point. Take, on the Bible side, for example,
a portion of the record of creation (Gen. 1:1-5):—

We will inflict no more of this <span class="tei tei-q">“undulatory

records before him, and can judge for himself which

former education, have acknowledged the authenticity
of the Bible, and the doctrines of Jesus as
recorded in the gospels. But these, it is claimed,
are to be understood according to a spiritual meaning
which underlies the letter; and this spiritual
meaning generally turns out to be contrary to the
letter, which is a virtual denial of the record itself.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There is implanted in the hearts of men by
nature, a sense of right and a sense of wrong. Even
those who know not God, nor Christ, nor the gospel,
possess this power of discrimination. This is what
Paul, in Rom. 2:15, calls <span class="tei tei-q">“the work of the law
written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing
witness, and their thoughts the meanwhile accusing
or else excusing one another.”</span> That this distinction
should now be denied by a class in a civilized community,
professing to be advanced thinkers and
teachers, among whom are found the learned, the
refined, and the professedly pious, shows that we
have fallen upon strange times. To be sure, many
of them talk fluently of the beauty and perfection
of divine laws; but in the sense in which they would
have them understood, they rob them of all characteristics
of law. The first great essential of law is

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is a favorite comparison with them,—that
the difference between God and the best of men is
so much greater than the extremes of character
among men,—the most upright and the most wicked,—that
the latter is a mere atom, and not accounted
of in God's sight. That there is an infinite difference
between God and the best of men, is all true; for
God is infinite in all his attributes, and man is very
imperfect at the best. But to argue from this that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
God is inferior to man, so that he cannot discern
difference in character here, even as man can plainly
discern it, seems but mad-house reasoning. What
would we think of the man who had the same regard
for the thief as for the honest man, for the murderer
as for the philanthropist? To ignore such
distinctions as even men are able to discern would
destroy the stability of all human governments;
what then would be the effect on the divine government?
God has given his law—holy, just, and
good—to men, and commanded obedience. He
has attached the penalty to disobedience: <span class="tei tei-q">“The soul
that sinneth, it shall die,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The wages of sin is
death.”</span> Eze. 18:20; Rom. 6:23. And in the
judgment, the distinction God makes in character
will be plainly declared; for he will set the righteous
on his right hand, but the wicked on the left. Matt.
25:32, 33.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This view of the failure of law, and the absence
of all human accountability, naturally leads to a bold
denial of sin and the existence of crime. The
<span class="tei tei-q">“Healing of the Nations,”</span> p. 169, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Unto
God there is no error; all is comparatively good.”</span>
The same work says that God views error as <span class="tei tei-q">“undeveloped
good.”</span> A. J. Davis (<span class="tei tei-q">“Nature of Divine
Revelation,”</span> p. 521) says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sin, indeed, in the
common acceptation of that term, does not really
exist.”</span>

In view of such a confession, what becomes of

guard them, to help and inspire them, and keep
them from evil and danger? These say that those
terrible crimes (and this would include all crimes)
are all necessary, that they are tending to develop
souls, and bring them to higher spheres, and thus
are just as laudable as good actions; so they settle
back in a gleeful mood, and <span class="tei tei-q">“let the play go on;”</span>
let wicked men cultivate and develop and practice

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus they very illogically assume that if God
has the will or the power to prevent evil, it could not
exist, and therefore, if there is such a God, he is responsible,
forgetting that God is long-suffering, and
bears long with vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,
before they pass beyond the limits of his mercy
and perish. But Mr. Davis says further:—

My brother has the spirit of revenge. Shall I call

made the non-resistant? Polygamy is as natural to one stage

The Bible says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe unto them that call evil

another declaration which finds abundant confirmation

Having thus attempted to destroy in the minds
of men all distinction between good and evil, all

men to give full rein to all the propensities and
inclinations of an evil heart, by teaching that there

they are responsible to themselves alone, and must
give account only to their own natures. Thus Hon.

This is the same principle of man's responsibility
to no one but himself, authoritatively adopted.
What a picture have we now before us! Destroy
man's belief in, and reverence for, God and Christ,
as they do; lead him to ridicule the atonement, the
only remedy for sin; make him disbelieve the Bible;
take away from his mind all distinction between right
and wrong, and assure him that he is accountable
to no one but himself; and how better could one
prepare the way to turn men into demons. All this
the spirits, by their teaching, seek to do. And can
any one fail to foresee the result? Comparatively
a small proportion of the inhabitants of this country
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have committed themselves to these views; consequently
but little of the legitimate fruit as yet
appears; but take human nature as it is and suppose
all the inhabitants of this land to act on these principles,
and then what would we have?—A pandemonium,
a scene of anarchy, riot, bloodshed, and
all depths of rottenness and corruption—in short,
a hell so much worse than that to which the Devil
is popularly assigned, that he would at once change
his location and here take up his abode.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That this statement is none too strong, will appear
as we look a moment at some of the results
which have already developed themselves among the
friends of such views, and as their inevitable fruit.
The tendency can by no possibility be otherwise than
to atheism and all immorality. As has been already
remarked, the repulsive features were made much
more prominent in the early stages of Spiritualism
than at the present time. They are now held in the
background. The literature touching these points
has been remodeled, and an air of respectability and
religion assumed. Most of the quotations therefore
date some years back, and would be charitably withheld
were there any evidence of reform either present
or prospective. But where or when have these
principles ever been officially repudiated, and evidence
given that the consequent practices had been
abandoned? That there are many Spiritualists of
upright and moral lives, and honorable members of
society, in the best sense of that term, we gladly
believe; but is not this because they are living above
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their principles; and due, not to the influence, but
rather to the non-influence of real Spiritualism upon
their lives? The quotations given are from those
who have been prominent among Spiritualists as
authors and speakers. If they overdraw the picture,
the responsibility is with them. Dr. B. P. Randolph,
author of a work <span class="tei tei-q">“Dealings with the Dead,”</span>
was eight years a medium, then renounced Spiritualism
long enough to expose its character, then
returned to it again, unable to break entirely away
from the spell it has fastened upon him. He gives
his opinion of it in the following scathing words:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

against what in my soul I believe to be the most tremendous
enemy of God, morals, and religion, that ever found foothold
on the earth;—the most seductive, hence the most dangerous,
form of sensualism that ever cursed a nation, age, or people.
I was a medium about eight years, during which time I made
three thousand speeches, and traveled over several different
countries, proclaiming its new gospel. I now regret that so
much excellent breath was wasted, and that my health of
mind and body was well nigh ruined. I have only begun
to regain both since I totally abandoned it, and to-day had
rather see the cholera in my house, than be a spiritual
medium.</span></span>

aver that during the entire eight years of my mediumship, I
firmly and sacredly confess that I had not the control of my
own mind, as I now have, one twentieth of the time; and
before man and high heaven I most solemnly declare that I
do not now believe that during the whole eight years, I was
sane for thirty-six consecutive hours, in consequence of the
trance and the susceptibility thereto.</span></span>

who, in that guise, gained my soul's confidence, and led me
to the very brink of ruin. We read in Scripture of demoniac
possession, as well as abnormal spiritual action. Both facts
exist, provable to-day; I am positive the former does. A. J.
Davis and his clique of Harmonialists say there are no evil
spirits. I emphatically deny the statement. Five of my
friends destroyed themselves, and I attempted it, by direct
spiritual influences. Every crime in the calendar has been
committed by mortal movers of viewless beings. Adultery,
fornication, suicides, desertions, unjust divorces, prostitution,
abortion, insanity, are not evils, I suppose. I charge
all these to this scientific Spiritualism. It has also broken
up families, squandered fortunes, tempted and destroyed
the weak. It has banished peace from happy families,
separated husbands and wives, and shattered the intellect
of thousands.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

months and for years its progress and its practical workings
upon its devotees, its believers, and its mediums, we are compelled
to speak our honest conviction, which is, that the manifestations
coming through the acknowledged mediums, who
are designated as rapping, tipping, writing, and entranced
mediums, have a baneful influence upon believers, and create
discord and confusion; that the generality of these teachings
inculcate false ideas, approve of selfish individual acts, and
endorse theories and principles, which, when carried out,
debase and make men little better than the brute. These are
among the fruits of Modern Spiritualism, and we do not hesitate
to say that we believe if these manifestations are continued
to be received, and to be as little understood as they are,
and have been since they made their appearance at Rochester,
and mortals are to be deceived by their false, fascinating,
and snakelike charming powers, which go with them, the
day will come when the world will require the appearance of

another Saviour to redeem the world from its departing from
Christ's warnings.... Seeing, as we have, the gradual
progress it makes with its believers, particularly its mediums,
from lives of morality to those of sensuality and immorality,
gradually and cautiously undermining the foundation of
good principles, we look back with amazement to the radical
change which a few months will bring about in individuals;
for its tendency is to approve and endorse each individual act
and character, however good or bad these acts may be....</span></span>

Every one who knows anything about Spiritualism
has heard of Cora Hatch, who traveled extensively,
and manifested her powers as an extemporaneous
lecturer before astonished multitudes. One of her
husbands, Dr. Hatch, renounced Spiritualism, and
the following is from the testimony he bore concerning
it:—

in spiritual circles, a very small percentage of which
ever comes to public attention. I care not whether it be spiritual
or mundane, the facts exist, and should demand the
attention and condemnation of an intelligent community....
The abrogation of marriage, bigamy, accompanied by
robbery, theft, rape, are all chargeable upon Spiritualism.
I most solemnly affirm that I do not believe that there has,
during the last five hundred years, arisen any people who are
guilty of so great a variety of crimes and indecencies as the
Spiritualists of America.</span></span>

Much testimony of this nature might be given
from those who have had similar experiences and
equally favorable facilities for judging of the character
of Spiritualism. We present only a few extracts more.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Dr. Wm. B. Potter of New York, in an article
under the head of <span class="tei tei-q">“Astounding Facts,”</span> and also in
a tract entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritualism as It Is,”</span> gives the
result of his experience and observations. His testimony
is the more valuable, since he writes not
from the standpoint of one who has renounced Spiritualism,
whose feelings may for the time be overwrought,
and his language stronger than would be
used in calmer moments. When he wrote, he was
still an advocate of Spiritualism, and spoke as a friend
who would, if possible, induce Spiritualists to reform
their faith and their manner of living. He says:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The same writer also mentions a fact which shows
where the responsibility of all this looseness of morals
belongs. He says:—

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fact that no plan could find approval which
did not provide that they should never be blamed
nor called to account for any of their deeds, shows
on what points they felt the most anxious, and
plainly proves that they belong to the class of which
Christ spoke, who loved darkness rather than light,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

should be reproved. John 3:19-21.

It is unpleasant to wade through pools of filth,
and we therefore spare the reader quotations from
those Spiritualists who have not only avowed the
most revolting practices of free love, but openly
advocated the same, and endeavored to induce others
to come out likewise, on the ground that they were
only honestly and publicly admitting what the others
believed and practiced in secret. For the same
reason we pass by the notorious Woodhull and
Claflin, and Hull and Jamieson episodes, in this field,
which, in the illustration and language of another,
<span class="tei tei-q">“burst upon the country like a rotten egg three
thousand miles in diameter!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be said that these things are in the past
and the situation has now greatly changed. For the
benefit of those who thus flatter themselves we introduce
one more quotation. It is from <span class="tei tei-q">“The Law of
Psychic Phenomena,”</span> by T. J. Hudson (A. C.
McClurg &amp; Co., Chicago, 1894). The language is
candid and conciliatory, and the author cannot be
accused of any undue prejudice on the question of
which he speaks. On page 335, he says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I do not charge Spiritualists as a class with being advocates
of the doctrines of free love. On the contrary, I am
aware that, as a class, they hold the marriage relation in sacred
regard. I cannot forget, however, that but a few years
ago some of their leading advocates and mediums proclaimed
the doctrine of free love in all its hideous deformity from
every platform in the land. Nor do I fail to remember that
the better class of Spiritualists everywhere repudiated the

the moral virus took effect here and there all over the
country, and it is doing its deadly work in secret in many an
otherwise happy home. And </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">I charge a large and constantly

community in the land, and it is well known to all men and
women who are dissatisfied or unhappy in their marriage
relations, that they can always find sympathy by consulting
the average medium, and can, moreover, find justification for
illicit love by invoking the spirits of the dead through such
mediums.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A few testimonies will show that when one gives
himself or herself up to the control of the spirits,
such ones take a most perilous position. The spirits
insist on their victims becoming passive, ceasing to
resist, and yielding their whole wills to them. Some
of their persuasive words are these: <span class="tei tei-q">“Come in confidence
to us;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Let our teachings deeply impress
you;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“You must not doubt what we say;”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Learn of us;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Obey our directions and you will

<span class="tei tei-q">“Have faith in us;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear not to obey;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Obey
us and you will be greatly blessed;”</span> etc., etc.
Mesmerists operate in the same way. They gain
control of their subjects in the same way that the
spirits mesmerize their mediums, and when under
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their control, the spirits cause them to see whatever
they bring before them, and hear according to their
wills, and do as they bid. And the things they suppose
they see and hear, and what they are to do, are
only such things as exist in the mind of the mesmerizing
power. The subject is completely at the mercy
of the invisible agency; and to put one's self there
is a most heaven-daring and hazardous act. Mr.
Hudson (<span class="tei tei-q">“Law of Psychic Phenomena,”</span> p. 336)
says:—

delegations from those realms of darkness and (to all but

matter how virtuously inclined—may, unless by constant
prayer and watchfulness they prevent it and keep the

abominable practices and habits.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

A work by A. J. Davis called <span class="tei tei-q">“The Diakka, and
their Earthly Victims,”</span> mentions the nature of these
denizens of the spirit world, and their wonderful
location. The country (to speak after the manner
of men) which they inhabit, is so large that it would
require not less than 1,803,026 diameters of the
earth to span its longitudinal extent. This he had
from a spirit he calls James Victor Wilson, a
profound mathematician! This space is occupied
by spirits who have passed from earth, who are
<span class="tei tei-q">“morally deficient, and affectionally unclean.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Page</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
7. The same spirit, Wilson, describes the
diakka as those <span class="tei tei-q">“who take insane delight in playing
parts, in juggling tricks, in personating opposite
characters to whom prayers and profane utterances
are of equi-value; surcharged with a passion for lyrical
narrations; one whose every attitude is instinct
with the schemes of specious reasoning, sophistry,
pride, pleasure, wit, subtle convivialities; a boundless
disbeliever, one who thinks that all private life
will end in the all-consuming self-love of God.”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Page
13.</span></span> On page 13 he says further of them, that
they are <span class="tei tei-q">“never resting, never satisfied with life,
often amusing themselves with jugglery and tricky
witticisms, invariably victimizing others; secretly
tormenting mediums, causing them to exaggerate in
speech, and to falsify in acts; unlocking and unbolting
the street doors of your bosom and memory;
pointing your feet into wrong paths, and far more.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What this <span class="tei tei-q">“far more”</span> is, we are left to conjecture.
The advertisement of this book says that
it is <span class="tei tei-q">“an explanation of much that is false and
repulsive in Spiritualism.”</span> W. F. Jamieson, in a
Spiritualist paper, called these diakka <span class="tei tei-q">“a troop
of devils,”</span> and quoted Judge Carter as saying:
<span class="tei tei-q">“There is one thing clear, that these diakka, or
fantastic or mixed spirits, are very numerous and
abundant, and take any and every opportunity of
obtruding themselves.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Hudson Tuttle, author of <span class="tei tei-q">“Life in Two Spheres”</span>
and other Spiritualistic works, speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“a communication,
through a noted medium, to Gerald
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Massey from his <span class="tei tei-q">‘dog Pip,’</span> the said Pip <span class="tei tei-q">‘licking
the slate and writing with a good degree of intelligence.’</span> ”</span>
He adds, <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Davis would say that
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Pip’</span> was a <span class="tei tei-q">‘diakka,’</span> and to-morrow he will communicate
as George Washington, Theodore Parker,
or Balaam's ass. This diakka is flesh, fish, or fowl,
as you may desire.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Some idea of how the spirits sometimes torment
the mediums, as hinted at above, may be gained
from the following instance. In <span class="tei tei-q">“Astounding Facts
from the Spirit World,”</span> pp. 253, 254, Dr. Gridley
describes the case of a medium sixty years of age,
living near him in Southampton, Mass. The sufferings
inflicted upon him <span class="tei tei-q">“in two months at the hands
of evil spirits would fill a volume of five hundred
pages.”</span> Of these sufferings, the following are
specimens:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">They forbade his eating, to the very point of starvation.
He was a perfect skeleton; they compelled him to walk day
and night, with intermissions, to be sure, as their avowed
object was to torment him as much and as long as possible.
They swore by everything sacred and profane, that they
would knock his brains out, always accompanying their
threats with blows on the forehead or temples, like that of a
mallet in the hands of a powerful man, with this difference,
however; the latter would have made him unconscious, while
in full consciousness he now endured the indescribable agony
of those heavy and oft-repeated blows; they declared they
would skin him alive; that he must go to New York and be
dissected by inches, all of which he fully believed. They
declared that they would bore holes into his brain, when he
instantly felt the action suited to the word, as though a dozen
augers were being turned at once into his very skull; this
done, they would fill his brain with bugs and worms to eat it
out, when their gnawing would instantly commence.
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">
These spirits would pinch and pound him, twitch him up
and throw him down, yell and blaspheme, and use the most
obscene language that mortals can conceive; they would
declare that they were Christ in one breath, and devils in the
next; they would tie him head to foot for a long time together
in a most excruciating posture; declare they would wring
his neck off because he doubted or refused obedience.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Who can doubt that such spirits are the angels of
the evil one himself? Dr. Gridley in the same work,
p. 19, gives the experience of another medium, for
the truthfulness of which he offers the fullest
proof:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">We have seen the medium evidently possessed by
Irishmen and Dutchmen of the lowest grade—heard him
repeat Joshua's drunken prayers [Joshua was a strong but
brutish man he had known in life], exactly like the original,—imitate
his drunkenness in word and deed—try to repeat,
or rather act over his most brutal deeds (from which for
decency's sake, he was instantly restrained by extraordinary
exertion and severe rebuke)—snap and grate his teeth most
furiously, strike and swear, while his eyes flashed like the
fires of an orthodox perdition. We have heard him hiss, and
seen him writhe his body like the serpent when crawling,
and dart out his tongue, and play it exactly like that reptile.
These exhibitions were intermingled with the most wrangling
and horrible convulsions.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These descriptions, it would seem, ought to be
enough to strike terror to any heart at the thought
of being a medium. But there is yet another phase
of the subject that should not be passed by. These
fallen spirits who are engineering the work of Spiritualism,
to maintain their <span class="tei tei-q">“assumed characters,”</span> and
<span class="tei tei-q">“play their parts”</span> like the aforesaid diakka, represent
that disembodied spirits <span class="tei tei-q">“just over the threshold,”</span>
still retain the characteristics they bore in life, such
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as a disposition to sensuality and licentiousness, love
of rum, tobacco, and other vices, and that they can,
by causing the medium to plunge excessively into
these things, thereby still gratify their own propensities
to indulge in them. The following sketch by
Hudson Tuttle, a very popular author among Spiritualists,
is somewhat lengthy, but the idea could not
better be presented than by giving it entire. In
<span class="tei tei-q">“Life in Two Spheres,”</span> pp. 35-37, he says:—

the eye grew less and less lustrous, slowly closing, the muscles

tobacco and alcohol! Oh, what misery confined in those
walls! If you have witnessed such scenes, then we need
describe no further. If you have not, then you had not
better hear the tale of woe. Imagine to yourselves a bar-room

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In these cases the whole evil of the indulgences
of course falls upon the mediums; and who would
wish to assume personal relation with such a world,
and be forced to bear in their own bodies the evils
of the unhallowed indulgences of unseen spirits,
against their will?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Other scenes represented as taking place in
the spirit land, are most grotesque and silly and
would be taken as a burlesque upon Spiritualism,
were they not put forth in all gravity by the friends
and advocates of that so-called new revelation.
Thus Judge Edmunds, giving an account of what he
had seen in the spirit world, mentions the case of an
old woman busy churning, who promised him, if he
would call again, a drink of buttermilk; he speaks
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of men fighting, of courtezans trying to continue
their lewd conduct; of a mischievous boy who split
a dog's tail open, and put a stick in it, just to witness
its misery; of the owner of the dog, who, attracted
by its cries, discovered the cause, and beat
the boy, who fled, but was pursued and beaten and
kicked far up the road. See Edmund's <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritualism,”</span>
Vol. II, pp. 135-144, 181, 182, 186, 189.
Surely here are the diakka playing their pranks in
all their glory.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the leading points of faith as held by Christians
generally, quotations have been given to show
sufficiently what the spirits teach, and the object
they are trying to effect. But the reader will be
interested to learn what they teach on some other
points which incidentally appear in their communications.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spiritualists object most strenuously to the idea of
unconsciousness in death, or to the Bible declaration,
<span class="tei tei-q">“The dead know not anything.”</span> But the spirits
themselves teach this very thing. Thus Judge Edmunds,
Vol. II, Appendix B, p. 524, quotes the
confession of a spirit that he was totally unconscious
for a time, he could not tell how long, and awoke to
consciousness gradually; and that the state of unconsciousness
differs with different persons, depending
on circumstances. A. J. Davis admits that Professor
Webster was eight days and a half unconscious.—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Death

Through Mrs. Conant, medium, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banner of Light</span></span>,
June 3, 1865, we have this information: <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
said that some spirits require a thousand years to
awake to consciousness. Is this true?—Yes, this
is true.”</span> In <span class="tei tei-q">“Automatic Writing,”</span> p. 93, the
spirits teach the same thing to-day. If others deny
such statements, it only shows that their testimony
is contradictory and therefore unreliable.

Again, the Bible doctrine that the incorrigibly
wicked must cease from conscious existence, is denounced
by Spiritualists; but on this point the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Having now sufficiently examined the teaching of
the spirits, a final question arises in regard to them,
whether it is possible to identify them, and determine
with any absolute certainty whether they are
the spirits of the particular individuals they claim to
be, or even spirits of the dead at all, or not. It
should be distinctly borne in mind, always, that evil
angels, whose existence has been proved from the
Bible, whose nature and delight is to deceive, can
walk the earth unseen, imitate and personate any individual,
and reveal their characteristics of thought,
writing, acts, form, and features, and make so perfect
a counterfeit as to defy detection. How, then, can
it be told what spirit it is, even though it shows the
face and features of some well-known friend? On
this topic, as on preceding questions, Spiritualists
themselves may produce the evidence. President
Mahan (<span class="tei tei-q">“Discussion with Tiffany and Rhen,”</span> p. 13)
remarks:—

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When it is considered, as already noted, that
spirits do their work through mesmeric power, it is
easy to understand how the medium is made to believe
that such and such a spirit is communicating
when it is not so at all. This question of identity
came up in the very early stages of Spiritualism, and
is no nearer settled, on their own confession, now
than then. A Mr. Hobart, in 1856, who claimed to
be the first Spiritualist in Michigan, made the following
admission:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

belonging to the same church, to induce them to hear. This
is necessary with some who are so bigoted they would not
believe unless a name was assumed which they respected.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
An article in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spiritual Telegraph</span></span>, of July 11,
1857, begins as follows:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The question is continually being asked, especially by
novitiates in spiritual investigations, How shall we know
that the spirits who communicate with us are really the ones
whom they purport to be?... In giving the results of our
own experience and observation upon this subject, we would
premise that spirits unquestionably can, and often do, personate
other spirits, and that, too, often with such perfection
as, for the time being, to defy every effort to detect
the deception.... If direct tests are demanded at all, we
would recommend that they be asked for the purpose of
proving that the manifesting influence is that of </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a spirit</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,
rather than to prove what </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">particular</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%"> spirit is the agent of its
production.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is an entire begging of the whole matter in
question; for it is not denied that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> spirit; we
want to know what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">particular</span></em> spirit it is; but for
that we must not ask; for it cannot be ascertained.
The same article states that other and lower spirits
often crowd in and take the place of the spirit communicating,
without the knowledge of the medium.
We might also quote <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritualism as It Is,”</span> p. 14,
that <span class="tei tei-q">“not one per cent. of the manifestations have
had a higher origin than the first and second spheres,
which are filled with low, ignorant, deceptive, mischievous,
selfish, egotistical spirits;”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Dealings
with the Dead,”</span> p. 225, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the fact is, good
spirits do not appear one tenth as often as imagined.”</span>

and that those who seek knowledge from them </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">cannot see nor
get hold of them</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; therefore to an extent they exercise a certain
power over those mortals who approach; and if the mortals
are themselves tricky by nature, insincere, ready to take advantage
of others, whether it be at the time of sitting or in
their daily life, rest assured they may be imposed upon by
spirits from the other side who occupy a like plane of existence
with themselves.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Mediums themselves will not trust the spirits,
according to statements made as late as 1896.
Mrs. S. A. Underwood, medium, in <span class="tei tei-q">“Automatic
Writing,”</span> p. 55, says:—
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">With all my experience in it, I would not to-day venture
upon any change, business venture, friendship, or line of conduct,
advised from this source, unless my own common material
sense endorsed it. Indeed, I would not take as fact any
of its even reasonable advice without question, because it is
not reliable as a guide in earthly affairs.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spirit communication, then, certainly does not
amount to much as a heavenly instructor, a celestial
guide to enlighten the ignorance of men. Whatever
we know ourselves, we may rely upon; all else is
uncertain. Again, on p. 56, she says:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Then the assumption of great names by apparently
common-place minds is a very strange thing. I was horrified
and annoyed when this occurred under my own hand, because
that is one of the things which disgusted me with spiritual
messages before this writing came to me, as I had occasionally
glanced over such messages. When I protested against
such assumption, I was told that </span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">‘</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Elaine and Guinevere</span><span style="font-size: 90%">’</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">
were not real beings, but types. So somewhere in our sphere
are spirits who embody cleverness in creations of their own
fancy, and adopt names suited to that fancy.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus the spirits themselves confess that the names
they often assume are not those of real beings, but
typical and fanciful. Nothing more, it would seem,
is necessary to complete the condemnation of Spiritualism,
so far as its own nature is concerned. When
in addition to all else, it appears that the spirits cannot
be identified; that the whole underlying claim
that the spirits are the spirits of the dead, must itself
be assumed; and that, too, in the face of the numberless
known falsehoods and deceptions that are constantly
issuing from the unseen realm,—there is
nothing left for it to stand upon.

action. No movement ever opened with more magnificent
promises. It posed before the world as an

Mrs. R. S. Lillie, in a speech at the Thirty-eighth
Anniversary services in Horticultural Hall, Boston,
Mass., and reported in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banner of Light</span></span>, of
April, 1886, said:—

<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Christianity never had a Pentecost to be compared with
modern Spiritualism. The latter is as far in advance of the
former, as the electric light is in advance of the tallow dip of
the past; for it is nineteen centuries ahead of it.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These are most astounding claims; and if there
is any truth in them, Spiritualism ought to have
shown itself as a great uplifting moral power, provided
it has been able to get any foothold among the
people. We therefore inquire what its success has
been. On this point Professor Keck, at the Thirty-ninth
Anniversary of Modern Spiritualism, at
Bridgeport, Conn. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Banner of Light</span></span>, April 9,
1887), said:—

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">It [Spiritualism] has made converts of more scientific
men and profound thinkers than any other sect in the world.
In thirty-nine years it has grown to ten or fifteen millions of
believers, with thousands of mediums, a literature printed in
every known language, and converts in every quarter of the
globe.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With all these facilities and all this success, it
surely has been able to make good its claims, and
fulfil its promises, if its nature is such as it assumes,
and its promises are good for anything; and its
course should be marked by a great decrease of
crime, by the promotion of virtue and a general
improvement in the moral tone of society, wherever
it has gone. For nearly fifty years it has now been
operating in the world; and with all its glowing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
professions of what it was able to do, and its millions
of converts, <span class="tei tei-q">“energized to all that is good and elevating,”</span>
its impress for good should everywhere be seen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But what are the facts?—Just the reverse of
what has been promised. Free love, which is free
lust, has followed in its wake; homes have been
ruined, families scattered, characters blighted; while
insanity and suicide have been the fate, or the last
resort, of too many of its victims. And outside of
its own ranks, in the world at large, the fifty years
since the advent of Spiritualism have been years of
increase of crime and every evil in a fast growing
ratio. Liquor drinking, tobacco using, gambling,
prostitution, defalcations, robberies, bribery, municipal
corruption, divorces, thefts, insanity, suicide,
and murder, have increased in far more rapid ratio
than the population itself.

The reader will remember the testimony of Dr.
Randolph, p. 105, that five of his friends destroyed
themselves, and he attempted it for himself, by direct

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It may be asked, What has this to do with Spiritualism?—It
is a test of the value of its promises.
Spiritualism has been posing for fifty years as the
<span class="tei tei-q">“world's reformer,”</span> the great energizing, uplifting
force to elevate mankind, the mighty power
which has come to empty our workhouses and
prisons, abolish suicides and all crime, the <span class="tei tei-q">“electric
light”</span> compared with the <span class="tei tei-q">“tallow dip”</span> of the
gospel. And yet with all these claims, with its
millions of adherents, and the funds and influence at
its command, it is allowing, year by year, crime to
increase much faster than the population. Now if
Spiritualism was the purifying, renovating power
which it claims to be, such results could not have
been seen. It is very evident, that, as a power in
the world in behalf of righteousness and humanity,
it has been of no account; and as between the forces
of good and evil, its weight has been on the side of
evil instead of good. It is thus that the author of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Spiritualism, the father of deception, fulfils the
promises made through that channel to deceive
mankind. What organized, aggressive efforts against
evil has Spiritualism ever shown? Where are its
schools and colleges? Where are its hospitals and
benevolent institutions? Where are its organized
charities? and what are its millions of members
doing to relieve suffering and distress, and turn men
to better ways of living? The very aspect it presents
to the world to-day, stamps the brand of Cain
upon its brow. The Boston <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Herald</span></span> of Dec. 17,
1874, said:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Let Spiritualism produce some idea, utter some word,
or perform some deed, which will have novelty, and yet be of
manifest value to the human race, and it will make good its
claims to our serious consideration. But it has not done this.
For nearly thirty years it has been before the world in its
present shape, and in all that time, with all its asserted command
of earthly and superterrestrial knowledge, it has never
done an act, or breathed a syllable, or supplied an idea which
had any value as a contribution to the welfare of the race, or
to its stock of knowledge. Its messages from learned men
who are dead, have been the silliest bosh; its stories about
life upon the planets are wretched guesses, many of which
can be proved false by the astronomer; its visions have
frightened scores of people into madhouses, and made semi-lunatics
of hundreds of others.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If this charge was good as late as 1874, it is
equally so at the present time. And thus are we
forced to the conclusion that Spiritualism, judged by
the light of its fair promises, is one of the most
lamentable of delusions, and most stupendous of
failures.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We come now to one of the most timely and
important features of this whole subject; for
God in his word has foretold and forewarned the
world of the movement here passing under review.
He has made known the time when it should appear,
the character it would bear, and the work it is to do.
He has also connected this with the great event of
all-overshadowing importance to this world, of which
it is a startling sign and sure precursor; namely,
the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We
ask the special attention of the reader to this part of
the subject.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A word of digression may be allowed as to the
place which prophecy holds in the word of God.
Prophecy is that feature of the sacred volume which
constitutes it a lamp to our feet and a light to our
path. Ps. 119:105; 2 Peter 1:19. It is that
which enables that word to be a guide to the hosts
of Israel through the weary journey and the gloomy
shades of time, giving to every era its <span class="tei tei-q">“present
truth,”</span> and showing the progress of the slow-revolving
ages toward the great consummation. It
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is the golden credential which the Bible holds up to
the world of its genuineness and authenticity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Prophecy is peculiar to the Christian Scriptures.
No other so-called sacred books contain this feature.
It is not found in the Vedas, Shasters, or Puranas of
the Hindus, nor the Zend Avestas of the Parsees,
nor the Kojiki Nohonki, of the Shintos of Japan,
nor the law books of Manu, nor the Koran of the
Mohammedans, nor the Kan-Ying-Peen or Tao-Te-King
of the Chinese, nor the Tripitakas of the
Buddhists. The reason is obvious. Neither the
minds of men nor of angels, either good or bad, can
read the future. Divine omniscience alone can see
the end from the beginning and foretell the great
events that shall mark the history of the world, and
affect the interests of the church. It is this that
stamps the Bible as divine, and lifts it immeasurably
above all other books. It is indeed passing strange
that all cannot see this. Instead of being a book
that grows obsolete and out of date with the passing
years, like the productions of men, it is the only
book ever seen upon the earth which is ever abreast
of the times in every age, and lifts the veil of the
future before him who honestly and reverently seeks
its pages for a knowledge of the truth. Those
who ignore or despise the prophecies, rob the Bible
of one of the brightest stars in its crown of
glory.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To be entitled to claim credit as divine, any
book or system should be able to show that it can
correctly foretell the future. The spirits see this,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and, knowing that they cannot do it, discountenance

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Spiritualists rail at God for prohibiting from Adam
and Eve, in the garden, the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, to keep them in ignorance. What
will they say to these spirits who coolly answer that
<span class="tei tei-q">“it would cost more than it is worth”</span> to give them
any knowledge of future events? This, perhaps,
they will consider all right because it isn't God who
says it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Let us then see what God has said of the time
and work and significance of Spiritualism. Over
seven hundred years before Christ, the prophet
Isaiah wrote of our time, as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“And when
they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep and that
mutter, should not a people seek unto their God?
for the living to the dead? To the law and to the
testimony; if they speak not according to this word,
it is because there is no light in them.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here is certainly a prophecy that a time would
come when just such a work as Spiritualism is now doing
would be a distinguishing feature of the age. The
present must be the time referred to, because it has
never been so in any past age; and the present meets
the specifications in every particular. It shows that
the only safety for any one now is to seek unto his
God, and make the law and the testimony, the word
of God, the great standard by which to try all spirits.
1 John 4:1. And another great event is directly
connected with this, that is, the second coming of
Christ; for according to verses 16-18, the disciples
are then looking for him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Matt. 24:24: <span class="tei tei-q">“For there shall arise false
Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great
signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible,
they shall deceive the very elect.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A deception of no ordinary power is here brought
to view. It really results in the division of Christendom;
for all but the elect are carried away by it.
In its own claims, Spiritualism fulfils the <span class="tei tei-q">“Christs”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“prophets”</span> part of the declaration, claiming of
course to be true, while the Bible says it is <span class="tei tei-q">“false.”</span>
The signs and wonders are beginning to be seen
in the many <span class="tei tei-q">“inexplicable”</span> phenomena attending
Spiritualism. But many more startling exhibitions,
as will be presently shown, are yet to appear. We
charge upon Spiritualism, so far, the fulfilment of
this prophecy. But mark! this occurs when the
Son of man is about to appear <span class="tei tei-q">“as the lightning
cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
west”</span> (verse 27); and it is one of the prominent
signs of that event. See the prophecy from verse
23 to verse 35. Mark and Luke also dwell upon the
same prediction, as gathered from the lips of our
Lord himself.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Heb. 10:28, 29: <span class="tei tei-q">“He that despised Moses'
law died without mercy under two or three witnesses.
Of how much sorer punishment, suppose
ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden
under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the
blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified,
an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the
Spirit of grace?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is the bold stand which Spiritualism has taken
against Christ and the atonement, that makes this
scripture applicable to that work. The apostle is
speaking of the times when the great <span class="tei tei-q">“day is approaching”</span>
(verse 25); when it is but a little while,
and he that shall come, will come and will not tarry
(verse 37), and the introduction of verse 29, in such
a connection, becomes a prophecy that such an outbreak
against Christ and his atoning work would be
seen when he is about to come again. And the fulfilment
we are now beholding in Spiritualism.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Rev. 12:12: <span class="tei tei-q">“Woe to the inhabiters of the
earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down
unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth
that he hath but a short time.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This scripture locates itself. It is when Satan
knows that he has but a little time to work, and
hence it must be in the last days. At this time he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
descends upon the world in an avalanche of wrath.
<span class="tei tei-q">“Wrath”</span> is a misleading term. The words θυμόν μέγαν
signify the strongest and most intense emotion of the
mind. If the object is to accomplish some particular
end, they would indicate the most intense, concentrated,
energetic, and persistent efforts to that purpose,
using every means, and bringing to bear every
influence to reach the result in question. Satan, as
we have seen, has an object in deceiving the human
family, as far as possible, to their destruction, by
signs and wonders. In this work, according to the
prophecy before us, he will go to the extent of his
power, and show his most potent signs. Bringing
the supposed forms and features of the dead before
living witnesses, is his most successful method at the
present time. But as this work is, as yet, done
largely in the dark, it gives more room for jugglery
and imposition. The time will come, however, when,
in open light, counterfeit materializations of the dead
will swarm on earth, and deceive, if it were possible,
the very elect—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, all who cannot meet the
deception with the potent weapon—<span class="tei tei-q">“It is written,
The dead know not anything, neither have they any
more a portion forever [in the present state of things]
in anything that is done under the sun.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Rev. 13:13, 14: <span class="tei tei-q">“And he doeth great wonders,

on the earth in the sight of men, and deceiveth
them that dwell on the earth by the means of those
miracles which he had power to do.”</span>

This prophecy relates to some earthly government
represented by a symbol with two horns like a lamb.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Verse 11. It is part of a prophecy beginning with
chapter twelve, and ending with verse 5 of chapter
fourteen. It is not the place here to introduce an
exposition of this prophecy. It is only necessary to

symbol represents our own government, the United
States of America.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>
And the great wonders that he
does, apply to the marvelous manifestations of Spiritualism.
It is a significant fact that Spiritualism
arose in this country, thus fitting itself exactly to the
prophecy. The climax of the wonders brought to
view in the text, making <span class="tei tei-q">“fire come down from
heaven on the earth in the sight of men,”</span> has not
yet been reached. More is therefore to be developed.
Yea, this wonder-working power is to go forward
till that which, in the time of Elijah, was
the test between the false god Baal and the Lord
Jehovah, is brought to pass, and fire is made to come
down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men.
And the sad feature of this case will be that the multitudes,
not perceiving the change of issue, will take
the act down here to be a test of truth, as it was in
the days of Elijah.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Taken in connection with other portions of the
book of Revelation, this prophecy reveals clearly
what the agency that works the miracles is. The
dragon, representing paganism (Rev. 12:3, 4); the
beast, representing the papacy (Rev. 13:1-10); and
the lamblike symbol, representing Protestantism,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or more specifically, Protestant America (Rev.
13:11-17), constitute the symbols of this prophecy.
For convenience, let us designate them as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C</span></span>;
respectively. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C</span></span> works his miracles in sight of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C</span></span>
are again brought to view in Rev. 19:20, and there <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C</span></span> is
called <span class="tei tei-q">“the false prophet.”</span> We know
the false prophet here is the same as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C</span></span>, because he
works miracles before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>, the same as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C</span></span>
does in chapter 13:14. All together, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A</span></span>,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">B</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">C</span></span> are brought to view
in Rev. 16:13, and unclean spirits like frogs are
said to come out of their mouths; and then verse 14
tells what they are: <span class="tei tei-q">“For they are spirits of devils,
working miracles.”</span> This, then, not the spirits of
dead men, is the agency that works the miracles of
chapter 13:13, 14. We follow the subject so far,
at this point, merely to identify the agency that
works the miracles, and shall have more to say upon
it. But before passing, we would remind the reader
that here also the subject is connected with the second
coming of Christ; for the prophecy of Revelation
13 ends with the redemption of the church
which immediately follows. Rev. 14:1-5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. 2 Thess. 2:9-12: <span class="tei tei-q">“Even him, whose coming
is after the working of Satan, with all power and
signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness
of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they
received not the love of the truth, that they might
be saved. And for this cause God shall send them
strong delusion, that they should believe a lie: that
they all might be damned who believed not the truth,
but had pleasure in unrighteousness.”</span>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here, again, we have the great fact brought out
with still more startling emphasis, that there is to be
a great outbreaking of Satanic power among men,
just before and up to, the coming of Christ. And
if we already see the preliminary and even far-advanced
working of this power in Spiritualism, the
world should stand aghast at the perils of the times
in which we live. The coming of Christ is brought
to view in verse 8, and verse 9 states that at that
time Satan will be working with all power. The
common version is calculated to obscure this passage.
The words <span class="tei tei-q">“even him”</span> (verse 9) are wrongly and
unnecessarily supplied. Literally rendered, the last
clause of verse 8, and the first of verse 9 would read
as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whom the Lord ... shall destroy
with the brightness of his [Christ's] coming; of
whom [Christ] the coming is, after [or at the time
of] the working of Satan,”</span> etc. The word <span class="tei tei-q">“after”</span>
is from, the Greek κατα (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">kata</span></span>), which when referring
to time, as in this case, does not mean <span class="tei tei-q">“after or
according to,”</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">“within the range of, during, in
the course of, at, about,”</span> as in 2 Tim. 4:1, where
it is rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“at.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So here is a plain declaration that at the very
time when Christ comes Satan will be working in
the hight of his power, by signs and lying wonders
(wonders to prove a lie) to keep the people under falsehood
and deception. Verses 10-12 tell who his victims
are, and why they become such: they are those
who preferred the pleasures of sin to the practice of
righteousness, and so would not receive the truth,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nor the love of it. In all such cases God's throne is
clear. He always, as in this case, sets truth first
before the people, gives them a chance, and calls
upon them to embrace it, and be saved. But when
men, as free moral agents, whom God will not force
into his kingdom, refuse to receive the truth, shut
their eyes, close their ears, and steel their hearts
against it, and find their pleasure in unrighteousness,
in going in just the opposite direction;—what can
God do for them? We leave the skeptic himself to
answer. For more years than Spiritualism, in its
present phase, has been before the world, several
religious bodies have made a specialty of the great
Bible truth concerning the state of the dead, and
life only in Christ, which effectually shields all those
who receive it against the rapping delusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Rev. 18:2: <span class="tei tei-q">“And he cried mightily with a
strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is
fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and
the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every
unclean and hateful bird.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Among the many predictions given in the word
of God touching the last days, is one which foretokens
a wide-spread and lamentable declension in
the religious world. The phrase which embodies it,
is the one just quoted, <span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon is fallen.”</span> The
term <span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon”</span> is not intended nor used as a term
of reproach, but rather as a descriptive word setting
forth the very undesirable condition of <span class="tei tei-q">“mixture”</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">“confusion”</span> in the religious world. It is certainly
not the Lord's will, who prayed that all his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
people should be one, that scores or hundreds of
divisions and sects should exist within his church.
That is owing, exclaims the Catholic, to the Protestant
rule of private judgment. It is not. It is
owing to that Pandora's box of mystical interpretation
placed in the church by old Origen, that prince
of mischief-makers. By this method, which has
no method and no standard, the interpretations of
God's word will ever be as various and numerous
as the whims and fancies that may find a place in
the minds of men.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But all this confusion must be remedied in that
church which will be ready for the second advent;
for no people will be prepared for translation but
such as worship the Lord in both <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spirit</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em>.
To bring the church to this point, a call has been
sent to Christendom in the special truths for this
time. Most turn away, but some are taking the
stand to which these circumstances summon them.
The process is simple. It is but to read and obey
God's word in the light of what is called the literal
rule of interpretation. No other rule would ever
have been thought of, if the Devil had let the
minds of men alone. By this rule the true Sabbath
would always have been maintained a perfect safeguard
against idolatry in the earth; the law would
have held its place as a perfect, immutable, and
eternal rule of conduct, a safeguard against the
antinomianism of all ages and the Spiritualism of
to-day; the view that the dead remain unconscious in
the grave till the resurrection, would always have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been held, and then there could have been no purgatory,
no masses for the dead, no Mariolatry, no
saint worship—in short, no Roman Catholicism, and
no Universalism, nor Spiritualism; the true nature of
the coming and kingdom of Christ would not have
been lost sight of, and the peace and safety fable of
a temporal millennium never could have existed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To say nothing of other errors that would be corrected,
suppose all Christendom stood together on
these four simple truths, how much division could
there have been in the Christian world? A second
denomination could not have existed. And what
would have been the condition of things?—As
different from the present condition as one can well
imagine—no paganism, no Roman Catholicism, no
Protestantism, no multiplied sects, no Spiritualism,—but
Christianity, broad, united, free, and glorious.
Some are taking their stand on these truths, and
so will be shielded from the delusions of these last
days, for which the way, by ages of superstition and
error, has been so artfully prepared. Every one
must stand upon them who is governed by the literal
rule of interpretation; for they are read in so many
words out of the sacred volume itself. But the
churches generally reject them, often with bitterness,
scorn, and contempt, and some even with persecution.
And this is why Babylon has fallen.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That organization, called in Rev. 17:5: <span class="tei tei-q">“Mystery,
Babylon the Great, the Mother of Harlots and
Abominations of the Earth,”</span> has been very generally
applied by Protestants to the Roman Catholic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Church; but if that church is the mother, who are
the daughters? This question has been asked for
many years. Alexander Campbell said:—
</p>

daughters of that mother of harlots—the Church of
Rome.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lorenzo Dow said:—
</p>

<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

</div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The great sin charged against Babylon, is unlawful
connection with the kings of the earth. The
church should be entirely free from the state. But
now the churches of America, which have for long
years borne so noble a part, are clamoring for a
union with the state, calling for a recognition of
God's name in the Constitution, and God's law in
the courts, and that the government be run on
Christian lines. Old, antiquated laws which they
find upon the statute books of various States, they
are beginning to use to persecute those who differ in
belief with them; and they seek for the enactment
of more stringent Sunday laws for the same purpose.
And when they shall succeed in getting full control
of the state, they will have severed the last link
that has held them to their high estate, show
themselves true members of the Babylonian family,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and sink in spirit and practice to the level of the
elder Rome.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Rev. 14:8 was fulfilled in 1844.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> Since then
the churches have been going down in spirituality
and godliness, catering more and more to the world,
indulging in carnal amusements, festivals, wife auctions,
and kissing bees, to the very border line of
decency, but especially filling up with the influences
mentioned in Rev. 18:2, till the leaven of Spiritualism
is fast penetrating the whole mass. Yet there
are a multitude of God's people connected with these
churches, who deplore the situation, and for whom
a crisis is approaching. The cry is again to be
raised, <span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon is fallen, come out of her my
people.”</span> We verily believe the time has come
when that call should be made and heeded; for a
little further progress in the evil path upon which
we have entered, will surely provoke the just judgments
of heaven. Verses 4, 5.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. 2 Tim. 3:8: <span class="tei tei-q">“Now as Jannes and Jambres
withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth:
men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the
faith.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first five verses of this chapter portray a dark
list of eighteen sins which will characterize professed
Christians in the last days; for those who bear the
characters described, have a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form of godliness</span></em>, but
deny the power thereof. The three following verses
plainly describe certain members of the spiritualistic
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fraternity; and they are said to be of the same sort.
This prophecy therefore becomes parallel to that
which has just been examined. The fall of Babylon
prepares the popular churches for Spiritualism. Here
the practice of these sins in the churches, makes
them of the same sort with Spiritualists, so that they
fraternize well together. Jannes and Jambres withstood
Moses by the wonders they were able to
perform; so these will resist the truth through the
wonders of Spiritualism. And this is in the last
days where we now are. So Babylon's fall just
precedes the coming of Christ.

9. Rev. 16:14: <span class="tei tei-q">“For they are the spirits of

God Almighty.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The work of the spirits reaches its climax in the
scene here brought to view. Their last mission is
to go to the kings of the earth to gather them to
the battle of that great day of God Almighty. In
this conflict, so far as this earth is concerned, the
great controversy between Christ and Satan closes
in the triumph of Him who rides forth on a white
horse at the head of the white-horsed armies of
heaven. The beast and false prophet are hurled
into a lake of fire, and the remnant, the kings of
the earth and their armies, are slain by the sword
of him upon whose vesture is inscribed the all-conquering
title, <span class="tei tei-q">“King of kings and Lord of
lords.”</span> Rev. 19:11-21.

But before these spirits can thus influence the
kings of the earth, they must make their way to
them and bring them under their control. They
have already shown great facility in this work, giving
promise of what they will be able to do in the
near future. A work by Hudson Tuttle, <span class="tei tei-q">“What Is
Spiritualism?”</span> p. 6, names the following among the
late and living crowned heads, nobility, etc., who
have been supporters of Spiritualism:—

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reader now has before him, in brief, the main
outlines of this momentous subject.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Spiritualism, so far as its phenomena are concerned,
is not humbug and trickery, but a real manifestation
of power and intelligence.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. But the marvels and wonders are not performed
by the spirits of the dead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Evil spirits step in and counterfeit what are
supposed to be the spirits of the dead, in which
men have been taught to believe, simulating points
of identity to any minute particular that may be
required.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Besides starting on this false assumption, all
their teaching shows that they are agents of evil,
not of good, and their work is to degrade, not
elevate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. The world by long resistance of the truth, has
prepared the way for this deception, which the spirit
that worketh in the children of disobedience is not
slow to improve.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. Even the churches of Christ, by rejection of
the truth, are preparing themselves for the same
snare.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. The Scriptures have plainly pointed out this
great outbreak of the working of Satan, and invariably
connected it with the last days and the second
coming of Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Spiritualism is thus a subject of prophecy,
and an infallible sign and precursor of the soon-coming
end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
9. The great day of the Lord is near and hasteth
greatly; and all things now call upon all men to
prepare for its eternal decisions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is this the lesson? Who will heed it and thus
escape the delusions and perils of these last days,
and be finally saved in the kingdom of heaven?
